** Colossians** 
** Christ is All You Need** 
 
===

    Paul wrote this short letter of 95 verses from a prison cell in Rome. You
    might call this Paul’s “95 Thesis” on the authority and adequacy of Christ.
    You will never find a greater discourse on the greatness of Christ. A
    careful study of Colossians will furnish a humble appreciation of the
    supreme authority and absolute adequacy of Jesus Christ.

===
 
    The apostle Paul expressed that Jesus Christ is the ultimate authority and
    complete sustainer of the Christian. He proclaimed Christ as the one and
    only fountain that is able to completely satisfy our thirst. Through the
    apostle Paul, the Holy Spirit warned the Colossians of the shallowness of
    philosophy, legalism, mysticism and asceticism. These are cheap substitutes
    for Christ living in and through you. Paul showed that human philosophy
    cannot provide an explanation for, or an understanding of, life. Each of
    these errors takes your eyes off Jesus as the source and sustainer of your
    life. Colossians answers the question: “Is Christ enough?” or more
    specifically, “Is He enough for you?”

===
 
    It is significant that the Holy Spirit is only mentioned once in this
    narrative (Col. 1:8). By explaining the Christian life without stressing
    the Holy Spirit, Paul removed the tendency toward mysticism by showing that
    the Holy Spirit’s ministry is ultimately * Christ in you* . In an era
    (AD 2016) when the Holy Spirit’s work is mystified, the emphasis of Paul in
    Colossians is a must-study. Whereas some teach that believers are lacking
    and need a second blessing or some novel experience to be complete,
    Colossians emphasizes just the opposite, stating we are already complete in
    Christ.
 
 
    ** The Authority of Christ** 
    – Do you believe that Jesus Christ the Creator rules supreme and sovereign
    over His creation? Do you acknowledge that in creation He is above
    everything including all so-called gods, angels, demons, animals and
    people? All of us ought to pause and honestly ask if there is anything
    eclipsing Christ in our thinking. Although many people in our day confess
    that Christ is good or important, they see Him as just one authority among
    many. If that describes you, the book of Colossians was designed to change
    your mind.
 
 
** The Adequacy of Christ** – Do you believe that Christ is adequate? Are you convinced that Jesus Christ is sufficient for all your spiritual needs? Is Jesus Christ** * part* **  of the answer or is He    ** * the* **  answer itself? Do you find yourself looking to religious activities like fasting, deeper devotion or penance to keep you in line spiritually? What influence does modern-day secular philosophy have on your mind? In the book of Colossians you will learn that nothing can ever replace Jesus Christ in meeting your spiritual needs. While many Christians believe that Christ is good for their lives, they are not quite convinced He is enough.
 
 
Colossians exalts Jesus Christ and shows that anything that takes you away from a dependence on Him is illegitimate.

** I. ** 
** Colossians 1:1-2 – An Introduction to the Book** 
 
 
** A. ** 
** An analysis of Colossians** 
 
 
1. A short ** <u>history</u>**  of Colossae
 
 
a. Colossae was a town in ** <u>central</u>**  Asia Minor, or modern-day Turkey.
 
 
    b. Historically it was a ** <u>major</u>**  city in the
    southwestern part of the Phrygian Empire (BC 1200-800) that predated the
    arrival of the Greeks under Alexander the Great.
 
 
    c. There were two ** <u>cities</u>**  that formed a triangle
    with the city of Colossae. They were Laodicea (Rev. 3:14-22) and
    Hierapolis. Colossians 4:13
 
 
1) By the time of Paul’s writing, Colossae had been dwarfed in both    ** <u>size</u>**  and importance by Laodicea and Hierapolis.
 
 
    2) In his commentary on Colossians, Bishop Lightfoot wrote, “Without doubt
    Colossae was the ** <u>least</u>**  important church to which
    any epistle of St. Paul is addressed.”
 
 
    d. Colossae hosted a prosperous ** <u>textile</u>**  industry
    and was particularly famous for its dark (crimson, purple, or glossy black)
    wool, called colosseum.
 
 
    e. For centuries a major ** <u>trade</u>**  route (highway) that
    went from Ephesus to the Upper Euphrates traversed Colossae.
 
 
    1) Later, around the ** <u>fifth</u>**  century BC, the road was
    rerouted through Laodicea.
 
 
    2) Many conclude that this contributed to the weakening of Colossae,
    eventually relegating it to a mere ** <u>country</u>**  village.
 
 
    f. Occasionally invading ** <u>armies</u>**  traveling to or
    from Europe trampled the area of Colossae.
 
 
    2. The ** <u>state</u>**  of Colossae
 
 
    a. The inhabitants of the city would have been mainly Gentile, though it is
    said that the Assyrian Empire exiled some 2,000 or more Israelites to the
    region in the fifth century BC. Even so, the majority of the inhabitants
    were ** <u>native</u>**  Phrygians or Greeks.
 
 
b. Though much smaller than its neighbors, Colossae enjoyed its share of    ** <u>wealth</u>** .
 
 
    c. History tells us a terrible earthquake destroyed Colossae in AD 60
    during the reign of the Emperor Nero. Even though it was later rebuilt,
    Colossae never regained its former ** <u>status</u>**  – a
    status that was already fading in Paul’s day.
 
 
d. Due to Turkish incursions in the twelfth century AD, the    ** <u>city</u>**  fell and the site was completely abandoned.
 
 
    e. Today Colossae lies in ruins in the Lycos Valley, smothered beneath 800
    years of ** <u>dirt</u>**  and debris.
 
 
    f. Only recently have excavations begun, causing excitement in both the
    Christian and secular archeological ** <u>worlds</u>** .
 
 
    3. The ** <u>church</u>**  of Colossae
 
 
a. Paul likely traveled near the city on his second missionary    ** <u>journey</u>**  but did not have God’s approval to evangelize there. Acts 16:6-8, Colossians 2:1
 
 
1) The evangelization of Colossae is believed to have been the    ** <u>work</u>**  of Epaphras (Col. 1:7, 4:12-13), a believer who may have been saved under Paul’s ministry (third missionary trip) during his three-year stint in Ephesus (100 miles to the east). Acts 19:10, 20:31
 
 
    2) Additionally, it may have been during Paul’s stay in Ephesus that
    Philemon was ** <u>led</u>**  to the Lord (Philemon 19). At some
    point the church of Colossae chose to assemble in Philemon’s home for their
    meetings.
 
 
    b. Whatever the case, Paul heard about their ** <u>faith</u>** 
    (Col. 1:4, 8, 9; 2:1) as well as some serious errors that required
    immediate clarification and correction.
 
 
    1) Amazingly, the writing of this text in AD 60-61 would have been just
    before, or even just after, the earthquake of AD 60. Needless to say, Paul
    seemed totally unaware of that ** <u>event</u>**  when he wrote.
 
 
    2) As he penned this ** <u>epistle</u>** , Paul was enduring his
    first incarceration in the city of Rome. He was awaiting trial due to his
    appeal to Caesar.
 
 
c. The Colossian church seems to have eventually succumbed to    ** <u>angel</u>**  worship. Michael the Archangel became known
    as the protecting saint of the city. He supposedly saved it from a
    disastrous flood as reflected in medieval art.
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** The attack on the Colossians** 
 
 
    1. Satan attacks God’s work through the spreading of false gospels or
    through teaching false ** <u>methods</u> ** of Christian living.
    If the devil can distract a Christian from the adequacy of
    Christ by any means, he is happy. Colossians 2:1-4; 2 Corinthians 2:11,
    11:3, 14; Ephesians 6:12; 1 Peter 5:8-9; James 4:7
 
 
2. The false teachings of ancient Colossae did not completely    ** <u>deny</u>**  Jesus Christ as Savior. Instead they cleverly
    diminished His authority as God come in the flesh. They put Christ in an
    inferior light in the minds of naive believers.
 
 
3. False teaching on how to live a victorious Christian life almost always    ** <u>attacks</u>**  Christ’s authority and adequacy. The
    message becomes, “Jesus Christ plus whatever (fill in the blank) equals
    successful Christian living.”
 
 
    4. What was taking the focus off the preeminence and adequacy of Christ in
    Colossae?
 
 
    a. ** Human philosophy** : This ** <u>error</u>** 
    teaches that you need Christ plus philosophy for successful Christian
    living.
 
 
1) This subtle seduction suggests that there are those who are in the    ** <u>know</u>**  versus the ignorant.
 
 
    2) This error keeps you ** <u>looking</u>**  to human knowledge
    and secular philosophy for the answers to life’s questions instead of
    looking to Christ alone. Colossians 2:6-10
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. ** Ritualistic legalism** : This falsehood teaches that by
    strict obedience to certain rituals, rules or regulations you can come to
    merit God’s favor. This error deceives you into taking your eyes off Christ
    and putting them on your own ** <u>efforts</u>**  and
    achievements to reach spirituality. Colossians 2:16-17
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. ** Experiential mysticism** : This erroneous belief implies
    that you are lacking and in need of something ** <u>more</u>** 
    in order to become a complete Christian. This error often involves a need
    to have visions, personal prophecies, encounters with angels, or
    supernatural experiences.
 
 
    1) This ** <u>false</u>**  focus invariably thrives on emotions
    and experiences over and above the Word of God.
 
 
    2) This mistake causes believers to ** <u>look</u>**  to
    experience for spirituality instead of to Christ. Colossians 2:18-19
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. ** Personal asceticism** : This popular concept proposes that
    self-denial, austerity, isolation, self-depravation, or greater religious
    fervor is the real ** <u>key</u>**  to spirituality.
 
 
    1) Interestingly, Paul pointed out that these won’t keep you from indulging
    your ** <u>flesh</u>** . Colossians 2:20-23
 
 
2) Instead of the abundant life being by faith through    ** <u>grace</u>** , this concept erroneously looks at
    self-depravation or self-abasement as the key to abundant living.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5. All four of these errors are constantly repackaged, often by
    well-meaning Christian leaders or famous authors, and reoffered to the
    church as the “key” or “** <u>secret</u>** ” to a deeper
    Christian life.
 
 
    6. All of these misconceptions were eventually encapsulated in Gnosticism,
    which in one form or another still exists ** <u>today</u>** .
    Without doubt, until Christ returns these heresies will remain an ongoing
    and constant threat to our spiritual progress. Thank God for the
    clarifications found in the book of Colossians.
 
 
    ** C. ** 
    ** The arrangement of Colossians** 
 
 
    1. This epistle breaks up into ** <u>three</u>**  sections.
 
 
a. Chapter 1 – Knowing Jesus Christ as preeminent and adequate for    ** <u>you</u>** 
 
 
b. Chapter 2 – Understanding your standing in Jesus Christ and that    ** <u>true</u>**  spirituality comes by means of God’s grace
    through dependent faith versus the counterfeits
 
 
    c. Chapters 3-4 – Living your life by faith in the adequacy of Christ,
    empowered by ** <u>Him</u>**  to do His will
 
 
    2. There are 11 verses in this epistle that highlight our position in
    Christ.
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:2 – We are in ** <u>Christ</u>** .
 
 
    b. Colossians 2:7 – We are ** <u>rooted</u>**  in Christ.
 
 
    c. Colossians 2:7 – We are ** <u>built</u>**  up in Christ.
 
 
    d. Colossians 2:10 – We are ** <u>complete</u>**  in Christ.
 
 
    e. Colossians 2:11 – We have been ** <u>crucified</u>**  with
    Christ.
 
 
    f. Colossians 2:12 – We have been ** <u>buried</u>**  with
    Christ.
 
 
    g. Colossians 2:13 – We are ** <u>alive</u>**  now with Christ.
 
 
    h. Colossians 2:20 – We are ** <u>dead</u>**  with Christ to the
    world system.
 
 
    i. Colossians 3:1 – We have been ** <u>raised</u>**  up together
    with Christ.
 
 
    j. Colossians 3:3 – We are ** <u>hidden</u>**  with Christ in
    God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
===
# D. Colossians 1:1-2a – The Authorship of Colossians
 
 
1. Colossians 1:1a – Paul signed his name as the    ** <u>author</u>**  of this letter.
 
 
    a. At birth Paul was named Saul. Saul was a Jewish name that signified
    “great one” or someone of ** <u>great</u>**  importance.
 
 
    1) Paul was born to ** <u>Jewish</u>**  parents in the Roman
    military enclave of Tarsus. His parents must have been somewhat affluent
    since they had him tutored under Gamaliel, a premiere teacher of Judaism in
    that day. Acts 22:3
 
 
    2) Paul was ** <u>born</u>**  with Roman citizenship. His father
    may have gained Roman citizenship through military service. To gain
    citizenship by means of military service you needed to have served a
    minimum of 25 years and received an honorable discharge. Acts 5:34,
    22:25-29
 
 
    3) History provides only one brief description of Paul from an uncertain
    source:
    * 
        a man of ** <u>small</u>**  stature, with a bald head and
        crooked legs, in a good state of body, with eyebrows meeting and nose
        somewhat hooked, full of friendliness, for now he appeared like a man,
        and now he had the face of an angel
    * 
    .
 
 
    b. As we see in the epistles, Saul was later referred to almost exclusively
    as ** <u>Paul</u>** , meaning small or little one.
 
 
    1) He was ** <u>initially</u>**  identified as Paul on his first
    missionary journey in Acts 13.
 
 
    2) Constantly being called ** <u>Little</u>**  One would have
    been an ongoing reminder to the apostle of his need for God’s grace. Paul’s
    unreserved acceptance of this nickname showed genuine humility.
 
 
    c. A ** <u>short</u>**  history of Paul
 
 
    1) ** <u>Before</u>**  salvation, Paul was extremely religious
    and self-righteous. Galatians 1:14, Philippians 3:4-9, 1 Timothy 1:12-15
 
 
    2) Paul ** <u>was</u>**  an aggressive persecutor of Christians.
    Acts 22:4, 26:10-11; Galatians 1:13
 
 
3) Paul was saved in a dramatic and sudden occurrence on a    ** <u>road</u>**  that led to the city of Damascus. Acts 9
 
 
    4) Paul was set apart by Christ as His ** <u>apostle</u>**  to
    the Gentiles. Acts 9:15-16, 1 Corinthians 15:8-10, Galatians 2:8
 
 
    5) Paul served God on ** <u>three</u>**  missionary journeys.
    Acts 13-20
 
 
    6) Paul ** <u>wrote</u>**  13 foundational books of the New
    Testament.
 
 
7) Paul suffered greatly for Christ with beatings, a    ** <u>stoning</u>** , imprisonments and finally execution in
    Rome around AD 67. 2 Corinthians 11:23-28
 
 
    2. Colossians 1:1a – In the church, Paul possessed God-given authority as
    an ** <u>apostle</u>** .
 
 
a. Paul was * an apostle of Jesus Christ* . Christ saved Paul and    ** <u>sent</u>**  him forth as an apostle, specifically
    dedicated to the Gentiles. Acts 9:15-16, 22:21; Romans 11:13; Galatians
    2:8; 1 Timothy 2:7; 2 Timothy 1:11
 
 
    b. Paul was an apostle * by the will of ** <u>God</u>** * 
    and not by personal ambition or human appointment. Let’s consider some
    general information on apostleship. Galatians 1:1, 1 Corinthians 1:1, 2
    Timothy 1:1
 
 
    1) The word apostle means ** <u>sent</u>**  one. The apostles
    were personally chosen and commissioned into service by the resurrected
    Lord Jesus. 1 Corinthians 9:1, 15:7-9, Acts 9:3-6
 
 
    2) As official representatives of Jesus Christ and divinely commissioned,
    the apostles laid the foundation of the ** <u>church</u>** .
    Apostles were God’s spokesmen. 1 Corinthians 9:1-2; 2 Corinthians 12:12;
    Ephesians 2:19-20, 4:12-13; 2 Peter 3:2b
 
 
3) Apostles became the spiritual authorities in the    ** <u>early</u>**  church and were used by God to write much of
    the New Testament. 1 Corinthians 4:8-13, 12:28; 1 Thessalonians 2:6; Jude
    17
 
 
4) There were only twelve apostles appointed    ** <u>directly</u>**  by the Lamb (Rev. 21:14). There are no new
    apostles being commissioned directly by God today. 1 Corinthians 15:7-10,
    Ephesians 2:20
 
 
3. Colossians 1:1b – * And Timothy our brother* … Timothy, a    ** <u>fellow</u>**  believer in Jesus Christ, was one of Paul’s
    assistants in ministry.
 
 
    a. Timothy was the son of a ** <u>Greek</u>**  father and a
    believing Jewish mother. Acts 16:1, 2 Timothy 1:5
 
 
b. Timothy grew up in Lystra, where Paul was almost    ** <u>stoned</u>**  to death. Acts 16:2
 
 
    c. He trusted ** <u>Christ</u>**  through the ministry of Paul.
    Acts 14:8-20
 
 
    d. Timothy was a ** <u>great</u>**  encouragement to the apostle
    Paul. Philippians 2:19-23
 
 
    e. He was Paul’s ** <u>faithful</u>**  fellow servant. Acts
    14:6-23, 16-19; 1 Timothy 1:3; 2 Timothy 1:5, 3:15
 
===
    ** E. ** 
    ** Colossians 1:2** 
    ** – The Addressees in Colossae** 
 
 
1. Colossians 1:2a –* To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ… * As a    ** <u>group</u>** , the recipients of this letter were
    identified as holy and trustworthy brothers in Christ.
 
 
    a. They were called ** * saints* ** * ,*  which means
    sanctified or set ** <u>apart</u>**  ones. This is a positional
    statement.
 
 
1) Saints speaks of the Christian’s standing in    ** <u>perfect</u>**  righteousness before God as already holy.
    This standing is true of all believers.
 
 
    2) The description ** * saints* **  is the single most used
    designation or ** <u>title</u>**  for Christians in the entire
    New Testament.
 
 
    3) This description, or title, speaks of the believer’s unchanging position
in Christ based on God’s acceptance of the finished    ** <u>work</u>**  of Christ.
 
 
    b. * And*  ** * faithful brethren* ** … This
description of the Colossian believers depicts them as faithful    ** <u>family</u>**  members. This is a conditional statement.
 
 
1) This description spotlighted the Colossians consistent walk of    ** <u>faith</u>** .
 
 
2) The mention of ** * <u>faithful</u>* **     * brethren*  in Paul’s introduction suggests the possibility of the
    existence of unfaithful believers in the church.
 
 
3) Obviously God desires that a believer’s condition or    ** <u>daily</u>**  practice (* faithful brethren* ) be in
    alignment with his or her unchanging position in Christ (* saints* ).
 
 
    4) When this is a reality in a believer’s practice, we call it walking by
    means of the Spirit or walking by ** <u>faith</u>** . 2
    Corinthians 5:7, Galatians 5:16
 
 
2. Colossians 1:2b – Paul addressed the faithful    ** * brethren* ** 
    * 
        ** <u>in Christ</u>** 
        ** who are at Colossae** 
    * 
    . We see that even though they were physically residing in the city of
    Colossae, spiritually they were found ** * in Christ* ** .
 
 
    ** F. ** 
    ** Colossians 1:2c – An amiable greeting to the Colossians** 
 
 
    1. When Paul said, “** * <u>Grace</u>* **  * to you,* 
    ” he was expressing his desire for a special blessing for the Colossian
    believers.
 
 
    a. ** <u>Every</u>**  epistle Paul wrote started and finished
    with a statement about grace. Colossians 1:2, 4:18
 
 
    b. Paul believed that ** <u>life</u>**  for the believer was to
    be lived by grace. Do you?
 
 
    2. * And ** <u>peace</u>** …*  Paul also desired God’s
    peace to rest over them.
 
 
a. True peace comes from an understanding of God’s    ** <u>grace</u>** .
 
 
    b. Does peace describe ** <u>your</u>**  life?
 
 
3. Colossians 1:2b – The statement ** * from* ** *  God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ*  shows the only true    ** <u>source</u>**  from which both grace and peace originate.
 
 
    a. We should also notice the word ** <u>order</u>**  of grace
    first and then peace.
 
 
    b. Truly you cannot experience peace without ** <u>first</u>** 
    being a recipient of God’s amazing grace.
    <br/>

# II. Colossians 1:3-14 – Paul’s Three-focused Prayer 
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** Colossians 1:3-6 – Part one: Paul’s prayer of thanksgiving** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 1:3-6 constitutes a single ** <u>run-on</u>** 
    sentence in Greek. Paul’s thanksgiving for God’s work of grace in these
    believers overflowed into a prayer for them to grow in their understanding
    of God’s will so that they would continue to bear fruit and please God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2. Colossians 1:3 – Paul gave God thanks for his    ** <u>fellow</u>**  believers in Colossae.
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:3a – * We give thanks* … Typical of Paul, he began his
    prayer by giving ** <u>thanks</u>**  for his readers.
    Philippians 1:3, Romans 1:8, Ephesians 1:15-16
 
 
    1) By saying, “** * <u>We</u>* ** *  give thanks,* ”
    Paul made it obvious that other believers were involved in intercession for
    the Colossians.
 
 
    2) The Greek verb translated * give thanks*  EU** CARIS** 
TOUMEN contains the word ** <u>grace</u>**  as its root.    * Give thanks*  literally means to joyfully speak of grace. In this
    case, Paul was joyfully speaking of the grace ** of God** 
    towards the Colossian believers.
 
 
    3) The verb is in the present tense, denoting the continual aspect of
Paul’s thanksgiving. Paul and his companions continually    ** <u>gave</u>**  thanks for the Colossians.
 
 
    4) When you get a glimpse of God and start to grasp His undeserved
    provisions, you cannot ** <u>help</u>**  but give Him thanks.
    Thankfulness is a central motivation in living the Christian life. True to
    this fact, Paul showed gratitude in every chapter of Colossians. Colossians
    1:3, 1:12, 2:7, 3:15-17, 4:2
 
 
5) We should not lose sight of the fact that Paul was in    ** <u>prison</u>**  as he gave thanks here. Are you full of
    thanksgiving in the midst of your life’s trials? James 1:2
 
 
b. Colossians 1:3b – He gave thanks to    * the ** <u>Father</u>**  of our Lord Jesus Christ* .
 
 
    1) Paul could have simply stated, “We give thanks to God the Father,”
without mentioning He was    * the ** <u>Father</u>**  of our Lord Jesus Christ* .
 
 
    2) This statement should bring to mind that just as God was always a
    faithful Father to our Lord Jesus Christ while He was on earth, He is a
    faithful Father to ** <u>us</u>**  as well. Romans 8:15,
    Galatians 4:6
 
 
    3) The same privileged position ** <u>Jesus</u>**  enjoys as a
    son, you also enjoy today. Ephesians 1:3, John 17:23
 
 
    c. Colossians 1:3c – * Praying always for you* … Paul wanted to let
    the Colossians know they were not ** <u>alone</u>**  in the
    battle of life; he and his fellow believers were consistently praying for
    them.
 
 
    1) * Praying ** <u>always</u>** … * Paul reminded them he
    was praying regularly for them.
 
 
    2) Later at the end of this ** <u>letter</u>** , he directed
    them in like manner to be devoted to prayer. Colossians 4:2
 
 
3) Paul’s exhortation to those under his care to    ** * <u>pray</u>* ** *  always*  (Col. 4:2) came on
    the heels of his example. In essence, Paul’s example says, “Do as I say and
    do.” He was not communicating, “Do as I say, but not as I do.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3. Colossians 1:4-5b – The motivation of Paul’s thankfulness was the
    pervasive testimony of the faith, ** <u>love</u>**  and hope of
    the Colossians.
 
 
a. Colossians 1:4a – * Y*     * our ** <u>faith</u>**  in Christ Jesus* … Notice Paul
    first focused on their faith, not on their works. Why might that be? If a
    believer has a vibrant faith in Christ, his faith will translate into
    commendable works before God. Romans 1:5, 16:26
 
 
b. Colossians 1:4b – * Y*     * our faith ** <u>in</u> Christ Jesus** * … Next Paul
    focused on their faith specifically being * in Christ Jesus* . Their
    faith in the person of Christ inspired Paul’s thanksgiving.
 
 
    1) Their*  …faith in Christ Jesus* … could refer to the fact that they
    believed in Christ and were ** <u>saved</u>**  by faith, but in
    this verse Paul included their faith together with their love, showing he
    was not speaking solely of their initial faith in Christ for salvation. He
    was also speaking about their daily walk of faith. Galatians 2:20
 
 
    2) Paul referred to the fact that they were ** <u>daily</u>** 
    walking by faith. This is comparable to Paul’s comments about the faith of
    the Thessalonians:
    * 
        Constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and
        steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ
    * 
    . 1 Thessalonians 1:3
 
 
    a) If someone were to thank God for you, would they mention your walk of
    faith?
 
 
    b) What is the object of your faith today? Is your life built on an ongoing
    walk of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, or do you trust in men, or worse
    yet your own strength? Jeremiah 17:5-8
 
 
c. Colossians 1:4c –    * And of the love AGAPE which you have for all the saints* … Paul was
thankful to hear of their unselfish love toward the whole    ** <u>body</u>**  of Christ. John 15:12
 
 
1) Romans 5:8 describes AGAPE love as both unmerited and    ** <u>self</u>** -sacrificial.
 
 
2) 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 details 16 interrelated qualities    ** <u>found</u>**  in AGAPE love.
 
 
    3) In Galatians 5:16, 22-23 we learn that AGAPE love is a fruit of the
    Spirit in the ** <u>life</u>**  of the believer as he or she
    walks by faith in the power of the Holy Spirit and not the product of
    self-effort or resolve. Colossians 1:8, Galatians 5:22, 1 Timothy 1:4-5
 
 
    d. Colossians 1:5a – * Because of the hope laid up for you in heaven* 
    … The Colossians’ walk of faith and love for one another were the result of
    their sure ** <u>hope</u>** .
 
 
    1) The Colossian believers were living with a ** <u>focus</u>** 
    on eternity and not allowing their present sufferings to crush their
    spirit. Ephesians 1:18, Colossians 3:2-4, Hebrews 12:1-3
 
 
2) By definition, biblical hope is confident expectation as opposed to    ** <u>doubt</u>** . Hope in the New Testament denotes certainty.
 
 
    3) As with faith, hope has an ** <u>object</u>** . Hope is
    always based on God’s Word and His faithfulness. Romans 8:24-25, 15:13; 1
    Corinthians 13:13
 
 
    e. Colossians 1:5b – ** Hope**  …
    * 
        of which you previously ** <u>heard</u>**  in the word of
        truth, the gospel
    * 
    . Paul gave thanks because ever since day one of their salvation they had
    unwaveringly held on to their hope.
 
 
    4. Colossians 1:5c-6 – Paul gave thanks to God for the extent of the
Gospel’s ** <u>reach</u>** .    * …the word of truth, the gospel… which has come to you* .
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:5c – What is * the word of truth, the gospel*  that
    Paul mentioned here?
 
 
    1) Paul is not using the word gospel here as a general term for good news.
He is referring specifically to the message of    ** <u>truth</u>**  that is to be preached and believed for
    salvation.
 
 
    2) Gospel here refers to the ** <u>saving</u>**  message as
    found in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4.
 
 
    b. Colossians 1:6a – The Gospel …* which has come to you* . Remarkably
    the Gospel had reached even as ** <u>far</u>**  as the declining
    town of Colossae.
 
 
c. Colossians 1:6b –    * …just as in ** all the world**  also* … Paul gave thanks
    that the Gospel message had reached ** <u>them</u>** , just like
    it was reaching all the rest of the world.
 
 
    1) The life-changing Gospel message is for the entire world, whereas
    typically false teachings are represented as for only the exclusive or
    privileged ** <u>few</u>** . 1 Timothy 2:4
 
 
    2) The worldwide offer of the Gospel stands in stark contrast to the
    exclusive or ** <u>secret</u>**  messages taught by false
    teachers.
 
 
    d. Colossians 1:6c – * …constantly bearing fruit and increasing…* 
Paul gave God thanks that the Gospel was spreading all over the    ** <u>world</u>** , and that as it spread, people were being
    saved and lives transformed. Romans 1:17
 
 
e. Colossians 1:6d – …    * even as ** it has been doing in you**  also…*  Paul gave
particular ** <u>thanks</u>**  for the impact of the    * grace of God*  on the lives of the Colossian believers as proved by
    their own personal transformation.
 
 
    f. Colossians 1:6e – …* since the day you heard of it* … The unsaved
    individual must ** <u>hear</u>**  the message of Christ’s death
    for his sins and Christ’s resurrection in order to be able to respond by
    faith and be saved. Romans 1:16, 10:17; Ephesians 1:13
 
 
g. Colossians 1:6f – …    * and understood the grace of God in ** <u>truth</u>** * .
    The realization of what we deserve for our sins and what God did for us in
    Christ’s death becomes the appropriate basis for a correct understanding of
    grace.
 
 
1) An accurate understanding of the grace of God is essential for    ** <u>initial</u>**  salvation. Romans 1:17
 
 
    a) Grace is not God’s ** <u>love</u>**  separate from God’s
    justice. God did not ignore His justice in order to show us His grace.
    Philippians 1:9, 2 Peter 3:18
 
 
    b) When Christ died on the cross as our substitute, God not only revealed
    His perfect ** <u>love</u>** , Christ also satisfied God’s
    righteous demands on our behalf. There is no greater picture of justice
    served than Christ’s death for sin. Romans 5:8, 8:32; 2 Corinthians 5:21;
    Colossians 2:13-14
 
 
    2) Understanding the grace of God in truth is not only important for our
    eternal salvation from sin’s penalty (phase one salvation) but also for our
    practical salvation from sin’s ** <u>power</u>**  (phase two
    salvation).
 
 
    a) We are not saved on the basis of our ** <u>works</u>** . We
    are saved by faith in the person and work of Christ. Romans 11:6, Galatians
    2:21, 1 Peter 5:12b
 
 
    b) We cannot live the Christian life by our own works either. The Christian
    life is by faith as we ** <u>depend</u>**  on Christ and His
    provisions on our behalf. Romans 1:17, Galatians 2:20
 
 
    5. Colossians 1:6 – …
    * 
        Since the day you heard of it [the gospel] and understood the grace of
        God in truth
    * 
    . Let’s take a closer look at the ** <u>Gospel</u>**  from 1
    Corinthians 15:1-10.
 
 
    a. 1 Corinthians 15:1 – The New Testament word * gospel*  EUANGELION
    simply means ** <u>good</u>**  news. The context defines the
    good news. When it comes to the saving message or the Gospel of our
    salvation, we discover the following:
 
 
    1) God has some really good news for ** <u>all</u>**  of
    humanity. Acts 17:30-31
 
 
2) The good news is that God has done everything necessary for    ** <u>our</u>**  salvation. John 19:30
 
 
    3) The good news is that ** <u>sin</u>**  has been paid in full
    by the death of Jesus Christ God’s Son. Hebrews 10:12
 
 
    4) The good news is that we can have eternal life because long ago Christ
    died for our sins and ** <u>rose</u>**  again just as the
    Scriptures predicted He would. Romans 4:24-25, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, 1
    Thessalonians 4:14a
 
 
    5) The Gospel is all about what ** <u>God</u>**  has done to
    save sinners through the person and work of Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-5a,
    11
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. 1 Corinthians 15:3a –
    * 
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received,        ** that Christ** 
    * 
    … The ** <u>person</u>**  who authored the Gospel is Jesus
    Christ.
 
 
1) The word * Christ*  in Greek is a much more loaded    ** <u>word</u>**  than what we perceive in English. When Paul
    used the term * the Christ*  he was talking about the one and only
    prophesied Deliverer. Genesis 3:15, Acts 10:36, Romans 1:3-4
 
 
2) We often think of the term * Christ*  as merely Jesus’    ** <u>last</u>**  name, but actually the concept is far more
    meaningful than that. The * Christ*  was the coming Deliverer, or
    Messiah, promised back in the Garden of Eden. He was to be God’s Anointed
    One sent to rescue us. Luke 2:11, Acts 2:36
 
 
a) The term Christ is the Greek equivalent of the    ** <u>Hebrew</u>**  word Messiah. Messiah means anointed one.
 
 
    b) The concept of an ** anointed one**  comes from the Old
    Testament where a ** <u>prophet</u>**  would anoint a chosen
    person with oil to signify God’s selection of that person for service. 1
    Samuel 24:6, Psalm 105:15, Matthew 12:17-18
 
 
    3) The Christ was God’s chosen instrument set ** <u>apart</u>** 
    for the work of saving all who come to God by faith.
 
 
    4) As the Christ, or anointed one, Jesus was the one chosen by God to be
    the Savior of the ** <u>world</u>** . Jesus Christ is the
    long-awaited Messiah. Isaiah 42:1, 61:1, Luke 4:16-21
 
 
    5) Therefore the Gospel had to do first of all with Jesus being the Christ
    who was appointed by God to come as a ** <u>human</u>**  and
    save mankind from sin. John 1:29-34
 
 
    c. 1 Corinthians 15:3b – * Christ ** <u>died</u>** *  [in
    our place, for our sins]. The Gospel message includes the work accomplished
    by Christ’s substitutionary death for us. Luke 24:27
 
 
    1) 1 Corinthians 15:3 – The phrase * Christ died * is at the heart of
the Gospel. If for salvation you trust in anything    ** <u>other</u>**  than the death of Christ you will not be
    saved. Your faith must rest in Christ alone.
 
 
    2) The Bible affirms that * the wages for sin is death* . When Christ
    died for our sins, He ** <u>paid</u>**  the price for our
    forgiveness. Christ’s death was the appropriate, sufficient and only
    payment for our redemption.
 
 
d. 1 Corinthians 15:3c –    * Christ died for our ** <u>sins</u>** * … The great
    accomplishment of the Gospel is Christ’s death for our personal sins. His
    death was the once-for-all payment for sins. His one-time payment provided
    everything necessary for our complete forgiveness.
 
 
    1) Christ died so that God could ** <u>forgive</u>**  sin
    forever. * For the wages of sin is death*  (Rom. 6:23). Through His
    death, Christ paid your sin debt.
 
 
    2) Nothing more needs to be done to resolve the sin issue between holy God
and sinful man. Sin was completely dealt with on the    ** <u>cross</u>**  of Christ. There is no longer any need for a
    sacrifice. 1 Peter 3:18
 
 
e. 1 Corinthians 15:3d – ** * Christ died* ** …    * according to the Scriptures and was buried* . We have two great
    confirmations that Christ did indeed ** <u>die</u>**  for our
    sins. The first is fulfilled prophetic testimony from the Old Testament,
    and the second is the fact that His lifeless body was placed in a tomb on a
    day in history.
 
 
f. 1 Corinthians 15:4-5a – …** * and that he was raised on the third day* **     *  according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared…*  We also have
    two confirmations of Christ’s literal ** <u>bodily</u>** 
    resurrection. First we have the literal fulfillment of Old Testament
    Scripture and second we have eyewitness testimonies.
 
 
    1) Christ is a ** <u>living</u>**  Savior. If Christ were still
    dead, He could not to save anyone. Hebrews 7:25
 
 
2) Christ is the source of eternal life. Having been    ** <u>raised</u>**  from the dead, Christ now offers eternal
    life to all who believe in Him. Romans 4:24-25, John 6:40
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
g. 1 Corinthians 15:11 – Concerning the Gospel message, Paul said, “…    * so we preach and so you ** <u>believed</u>** * .”
 
 
    1) Because Christ died for our sins and rose again just as God’s Word says,
    we do not ** <u>preach</u>**  any other message to the unsaved
    for salvation. Romans 6:23
 
 
    2) Many modern-day Gospel presentations ** <u>lack</u>**  the
    central underlying message of the Gospel, which is the person and work of
    Christ. 1 Corinthians 1:23, 2:2; Galatians 6:14
 
 
3) If the Gospel we preach does not contain the    ** <u>core</u>**  issues outlined in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, we
    are not preaching the ** true**  Gospel as presented in the New
    Testament.
 
 
    4) Likewise, if the Gospel message we preach contains additions to Christ’s
person and work we are not faithfully preaching the    ** <u>Gospel</u>**  of Christ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** Colossians 1:7-8 ** 
    ** – ** 
    ** Epaphras:** 
    **  An interlude in ** 
    ** Paul’s prayer** 
     
 
 
1. Colossians 1:7a –    * Just as you ** <u>learned</u>**  it from Epaphras* .
    Epaphras was God’s witness who was the first to preach the Gospel of grace
    to the Colossians. Epaphras was part of the Colossian church. Colossians
    4:12, Philemon 23
 
 
2. Colossians 1:7b – Paul spoke of Epaphras as …    * our beloved fellow bondservant* . Paul testified that he had a
    loving companion and trustworthy ** <u>fellow</u>**  laborer in
    the person of Epaphras.
 
 
3. Colossians 1:7c – * W*     * ho is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf* … Epaphras
    ministered on behalf of Christ. By mentioning the faithfulness of Epaphras,
    Paul astutely encouraged following Epaphras’ teachings and example as
opposed to those who might ** <u>not</u>**  be    * faithful servants ** of Christ** * .
 
 
    4. Colossians 1:8 –
    * 
        And he also informed us of your ** <u>love</u>**  in the
        Spirit.
    * 
    Epaphras was the one who told Paul of the spiritual progress of the
    Colossians, specifically of their love produced by the Holy Spirit.
 
 
a. As mentioned in the introduction, this is the one and    ** <u>only</u>**  reference to the Holy Spirit in the entire
    epistle.
 
 
    b. In Colossians, Paul associated with ** <u>Christ</u>**  the
    activities he might normally associate with the Holy Spirit. (Compare
    Colossian 3:16 with Ephesians 5:18)
 
 
    c. Paul may have made this shift in order to ** exalt**  Jesus
    Christ in the thinking of the Colossians and to correct a flawed viewpoint
    concerning the ** <u>true</u>**  ** source**  of
    spirituality. This fact would help them appreciate and depend on both the
    authority and adequacy of Christ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** C. ** 
    ** Colossians 1:9-12 – ** 
    ** Part two: ** 
    ** Paul’s prayer for their continuing maturity** 
 
 
1. Colossians 1:9 – The prayer of Paul and his companions was    ** <u>full</u>**  of heartfelt concern for the well-being of the
    Colossians.
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:9a –
    * 
        For this reason, since the ** <u>day</u>**  we heard of it…
    * 
    Paul pointed out that they began to pray for the Colossians from the day
    they first got news of their salvation.
 
 
b. Colossians 1:9b –    * We have not ceased to ** <u>pray</u>** …*  Paul and his
    companions were persistent in their prayers, consistently remembering the
    Colossians right up to the present day.
 
 
    1) The phrase * not cease*  EU PAUOMETHA literally means to do
    something without taking a ** <u>rest</u>** , or pausing.
 
 
    2) Paul prayed because he knew that God is able to do in a believer’s life
    * 
        far more abundantly ** <u>beyond</u>**  all that we ask or
        think
    * 
    . Ephesians 3:14-21
 
 
    3) Consistency in ** <u>prayer</u>**  is as important as
    consistency in teaching. Like Paul, we should dedicate ourselves to
    intercession for God’s people.
 
 
c. Colossians 1:9c –    * We have not ceased to pray ** for you** …*  The apostle’s
genuine concern for the Colossian believers can be seen in the    ** <u>two</u>**  intimate words * for you* .
 
 
d. Colossians 1:9d –    * We have not ceased to pray for you ** and to ask** … * To
    ask AITEO means to ** <u>beg</u>** , or intensely plead, on
    someone’s behalf. We see Paul and his prayer companions imploring God to
    respond to their requests.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 1:9 – * To pray for you and to ask…*  We will now focus
    in on the ** <u>heart</u>**  of Paul’s petition for the
    Colossians. What was the central request of his prayer?
 
 
a. Colossians 1:9e – Paul prayed    * that [they] may be filled with the knowledge*  of God’s will. Paul
    wanted God to abundantly ** <u>fill</u>**  the Colossians with a
    precise kind of knowledge.
 
 
    1) The verb * filled*  PLEROO conveys the idea of being filled all the
    way to the ** <u>top</u>** , even to the point of overflowing.
 
 
    2) This verb PLEROO is in the passive voice meaning it would be someone
    else – God in this case – who would ** <u>do</u>**  the filling.
 
 
    3) Paul prayed that ** <u>God</u>**  would completely fill the
    Colossian believers with * knowledge* .
 
 
    a) The Greek word for * knowledge*  EPIGNOSIS is made up of the
    preposition EPI meaning ** <u>apt</u>**  or fitting and the
    common verb GNOSIS * knowledge* . This word therefore describes
    experiential or firsthand knowledge and entails discernment, recognition or
    perception.
 
 
    b) When Paul prayed that God would give them ** <u>all</u>** 
    the same knowledge EPIGNOSIS, he was giving an indirect rebuke to false
    teachers who claimed to have secret knowledge, unknowable to the average
    person.
 
 
    c) Interestingly, the words ** mystery**  MUSTERION (Col.
    1:26-27, 2:2, 4:3), ** knowledge**  GNOSIS, EPIGNOSIS (Col.
    1:9-10, 2:2, 3:10), and ** fullness**  PLEROMA (Col. 1:19, 2:10)
were all extensively used by Gnostics who taught that ** they**     ** alone**  had the ** <u>full</u>**  understanding
    of mysteries.
 
 
b. Colossians 1:9f – Paul specifically prayed for the Colossians to be    * filled with the knowledge ** of God’s <u>will</u>** * .
 
 
1) Paul labored to help believers understand God’s will for them – the    ** <u>mystery</u>**  not revealed in past dispensations. 1
    Corinthians 2:7, Ephesians 3:9, Colossians 1:26
 
 
    2) Paul understood the immense ** <u>value</u>**  of
    intercession. Even though Paul sought to explain God’s truth clearly, he
    knew the only way for the Colossians to understand God’s will was for God
    to teach them. 1 Corinthians 3:6
 
 
3) From Paul’s example, we should learn not only the importance of    ** <u>prayer</u>**  but also what should be the content of our
    prayers for other believers. Ephesians 1:16-19, 3:14-21
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Colossians 1:9g – Paul specifically prayed the Colossian believers would
be filled with an understanding of God’s will    * in all spiritual ** <u>wisdom</u>** * .
 
 
    1) Spiritual wisdom can ** <u>only</u>**  be understood by the
    believer who is taught by God’s Spirit. 1 Corinthians 2:6-14
 
 
    2) An unsaved person cannot understand God’s ** <u>ways</u>** .
    1 Corinthians 2:14
 
 
    3) 1 Corinthians 2:6-7a –
    * 
Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are        ** <u>mature</u>** ; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor
        of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God’s

    …
 
 
d. Colossians 1:9h – Paul also prayed for the Colossian believers to be    ** <u>filled</u>**  with the knowledge of God’s will in all
    spiritual*  …understanding* .
 
 
1) The word * understanding*  SUNESIS in Greek literally    ** <u>means</u>**  a running together or a flowing together,
    like the joining of two rivers. The word denotes the ability to understand
    concepts and see relationships between them.
 
 
    2) To * understand*  God’s will is a process of properly combining the
    knowledge of the Word of God with ** <u>real</u>** -life
    experience. Since this process must be divinely initiated, Paul correctly
    made this a second aspect of his petition for the Colossians. John 14:26, 1
    Corinthians 2:12, Ephesians 1:17-18
 
 
    3) 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 –
    * 
        I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. So then
        neither the one who plants nor the one who water is anything, but God
        who ** <u>causes</u>**  the growth
    * 
    . Colossians 2:19b
 
 
4) Acquiring spiritual*  understanding*     ** <u>guards</u>**  you against reliving the first year of your
    Christian life for the twentieth time. James 1:21-25
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    * 3. * 
Colossians 1:10-11 – Being filled with the knowledge of God’s will* in all spiritual wisdom and understanding*  produces amazing    ** <u>results</u>** . Paul told the Colossians what they could
    expect in answer to his prayer.  
 
 
a. Colossians 1:10a – …    * to walk in a manner ** <u>worthy</u>**  of the Lord* .
    The first blessing that would flow from knowing God’s will in all spiritual
    wisdom and understanding would be a changed walk.
 
 
    1) * To walk in a manner worthy of the Lord*  means that their lives
    would be a ** <u>tribute</u>**  to the Lord and His amazing
    grace. 1 Corinthians 15:10, Ephesians 2:7
 
 
    2) Paul knew that if the Colossian believers were filled with the knowledge
    of God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding they would
    inevitably ** <u>walk</u>** , or live their lives, in a way that
    gave credit to God’s name. Titus 2:5b
 
 
b. Colossians 1:10b – * …to please Him in all respects* … If they were    * filled with the knowledge of God’s will* , the Colossian believers
    would be able to live a ** <u>life</u>**  completely pleasing to
    God.
 
 
    1) This amplifies the previous statement of walking in a worthy manner. The
    outcome of a worthy walk is a life that ** <u>pleases</u>**  the
    Father.
 
 
    2) ** <u>Jesus</u>**  fully pleased the Father as seen in the
    statement, “* This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased* .”
    Paul prayed for the Colossians because he wanted them also to be pleasing
    to their God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Colossians 1:10c – * Bearing fruit in every good work* … Knowing
    God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding would enable to the
    Colossians to ** <u>bear</u>**  fruit in the good works God had
    for each of them. Ephesians 2:10, Titus 2:14
 
 
    1) A natural outcome of a worthy ** <u>walk</u>**  is
    fruit-bearing. It was not Paul’s desire that they simply do good works;
    Paul wanted their good works to be fruitful.
 
 
    2) This verse implies that ** <u>not</u>**  all good works are
    fruitful. How can that be? If good works are done in a believer’s own
    strength, they are valueless and will not be recompensed at the Judgment
    Seat of Christ. Romans 7:18, 24; 2 Corinthians 5:9-11; 2 Peter 1:8-10
 
 
    a) Philippians 1:9 –
    * 
        And this I ** <u>pray</u>** , that your love may abound
        still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment…
    * 
Paul prayed for the love of the Philippians to be based in    *  real knowledge*  and * all discernment * AISTHESIS, meaning
    insight and full comprehension.
 
 
    b) Philippians 1:10 – He prayed this
    * 
        so that [they might] approve the things that are excellent, in order to
        be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ.
    * 
    ” In order to ** <u>please</u>**  God, the Philippians needed to
    first have the knowledge and discernment of God’s will.
 
 
    c) Philippians 1:11 – …
    * 
        having been filled with the fruit of righteousness, which comes through
        Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God
    * 
    . Ultimately though, the ** <u>fruit</u>**  of righteousness
    would be the product of Christ living His life through them as they walked
    by faith in Him. John 15:4-5; Galatians 2:20, 5:22
 
 
    3) The good deeds which will be rewarded are those produced through us by
    Jesus Christ as we ** <u>walk</u>**  by faith. 1 Corinthians
    3:12-13, 15:10; 2 Corinthians 4:7; Ephesians 3:16-17; Philippians 2:12-15;
    Hebrews 13:21
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Colossians 1:10d – As God answered Paul’s prayer for the Colossians to
be filled with the knowledge of God’s will, they would be* increasing in the knowledge * EPIGNOSIS    *  of ** <u>God</u>** * .
 
 
    1) A growing knowledge of God is essential for ** <u>life</u>** 
    . The more you know God the less you depend on other things. Galatians 4:9
 
 
    2) This speaks of ** <u>more</u>**  than mere intellectual
    knowledge of God and His attributes, although our knowledge must start
    there. This involves firsthand knowledge of God gained by learning to daily
    lean on His Word in the midst of trials and tribulations. Psalm 9:10, John
    17:3, 1 John 2:13
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    e. Colossians 1:11a – As a ** <u>result</u>**  of the Colossians
    being filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and
understanding they would also be    * strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might* . 2
    Peter 1:3-4
 
 
    1) Through knowing God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding we
learn that He has provided for us    * His glorious ** <u>might</u>** * . Ephesians 1:18-19
 
 
    2) God is not looking for inherently ** <u>strong</u>** 
    believers. He is looking for humbly dependent believers. A weak believer
    quickly learns to rely on God’s strength, while a supposedly strong
    believer falls prey to self-sufficient arrogance. 1 Corinthians 10:12; 2
    Corinthians 2:3-5, 12:9-10
 
 
    f. Colossians 1:11b – As a result of being filled with the knowledge of
    God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding the Colossian
    believers would ultimately grow to the point of
    * 
        attaining of ** <u>all</u>**  steadfastness and patience
    * 
    .
 
 
    1) Steadfastness HYPOMONEN means to endure ** <u>under</u>** 
    trials or to bear up under difficulties. This kind of stamina comes only
    through our knowledge of God’s plan and will for us in Christ. Therefore,
    stamina comes through the knowledge of what we have in Christ and who
    Christ is for our sake.
 
 
    2) Though similar concepts, the difference between * steadfastness* 
    and * patience*  is that while * steadfastness*  has to do with
bearing up under trials, * patience*  MAKROTHYMIAN has to do with    ** <u>long</u>** -term endurance in trials. Romans 5:3-5, James
    1:2-4
 
 
3) Clearly, the Colossians needed God’s glorious    ** <u>strength</u>**  to be able to patiently and steadfastly
    persevere under hardship. Ephesians 3:16, Philippians 4:13
 
 
    4) We should ** <u>grow</u>**  in our understanding of God’s
    will to the point that we joyfully weather every trial, although in the end
    it is Christ who gives us stamina and ultimately gets all the glory. 2
    Corinthians 3:4-6
 
 
    ** D. ** 
    ** Colossians 1:12-14 – ** 
    ** Part three: Paul’s prayer of worship** 
     
 
 
1. Colossians 1:11c-12a –    * Joyously ** <u>giving</u>**  thanks to the Father* … If
    God would answer Paul’s prayer for the Colossian believers to be filled
    with the knowledge of God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
    the Colossians would truly have ** <u>reason</u>**  to rejoice
    and be thankful.
 
 
    a. Paul prayed with the high hopes that the Colossians would joyfully and
    continually give thanks* .*  Clearly this only occurs when one is
    occupied with ** <u>Christ</u>** , living dependently on Him.
    Colossians 3:15-16, Hebrews 12:1-2
 
 
    b. When a believer is unthankful, something is wrong with his
    understanding. Maybe he doesn’t know the truth, remember the truth,
    appreciate the truth or is proudly choosing to ignore it, but whatever the
    case, he will be ** <u>bitter</u>** .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2. Colossians 1:12b –    * Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us* … Paul’s prayer
    continued with ** <u>praise</u>**  to God for their (our) future
    blessings in Christ.
 
 
a. Colossians 1:12b – Paul rejoiced because our heavenly** <u>Father</u>**  has already …    * qualified us to share in the inheritance.* 
 
 
    1) As believers, we ** <u>share</u>**  in Christ’s inheritance.
    Through our salvation we became co-heirs with Christ. Romans 8:17
 
 
    2) Based upon the aorist tense of the verb * qualified*  HIKANOO (made
    us fit), this is something God has already accomplished at a point in time
    in the ** <u>past</u>** . As saints, our qualification to
    inherit is a done deal. This is an issue that God has intentionally taken
    upon Himself to provide for every believer.
 
 
    3) Thankfully, according to this verse, God, ** <u>not</u>** 
YOU, is the guarantor of your future inheritance. You will    ** never**  be qualified for it based on your own merits. Your
    inheritance is not something you earn by good behavior. Hebrews 9:15, 1
    Peter 1:4
 
 
    4) The Holy ** <u>Spirit</u>**  who lives in every believer is
    God’s guarantee of future participation in the inheritance. Ephesians
    1:13-14
 
 
    5) The promise of a future inheritance for the believer is just as secure
    as our future hope of eternal ** <u>life</u>** . They go hand in
    hand. Amazingly, God is the one who prequalified us to share in the
    inheritance and He did so on the day of our salvation. Titus 3:7
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Colossians 1:12c – Paul praised God for the future    * inheritance ** of the saints in Light** * . This means
    that just as we once owned a portion of the kingdom of darkness, now as
believers we possess a portion in the soon-to-come kingdom of    ** <u>light</u>** . Acts 26:18, Ephesians 5:8
 
 
1) In His foreknowledge, God predestined all who    ** <u>believe</u>**  in Christ to have a part in His
    inheritance. Romans 8:28-30, Ephesians 1:11, 18
 
 
2) The phrase * in light * speaks of our glorification and    ** <u>future</u>**  participation in God’s eternal kingdom. 1
    Peter 1:3-8, Revelation 22:5
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. 1 Peter 1:4 – As saints and ** <u>children</u>**  of God, we
    have an inheritance that is permanent.
 
 
    1) This verse marks a clear distinction between heaven and our inheritance.
    According to this verse, heaven is not our inheritance, rather heaven is
    the bank where our inheritance is ** <u>kept</u>** .
 
 
    a) On this earth, people can die before they get their inheritance. Or
    their inheritance can be stolen, lost, burned, corrupted, etc., but in
    heaven there is no ** <u>fear</u>**  of losing your inheritance.
 
 
    b) Peter stated that our inheritance is guaranteed for us in our promised
    heavenly home. It is safe and secure and never merited, not even on our
    best day. It cannot be ** <u>lost</u>** .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) In this verse, Peter made several adamant declarations concerning the
    certainty of our ** <u>future</u>**  participation in Christ’s
    inheritance in heaven.
 
 
    a) We have an * imperishable * inheritance. Being everlasting, our
    inheritance can ** <u>never</u>**  be destroyed.
 
 
b) We have an * undefiled * inheritance. Our inheritance can never be    ** <u>spoiled</u>** .
 
 
    c) We have an * unfading * inheritance. Our inheritance will never
    diminish or lose its ** <u>beauty</u>** .
 
 
d) We have an inheritance that is    * reserved in ** <u>heaven</u>**  for * [us]* .*  Our
    inheritance is permanently earmarked for us, being guarded for us by God in
    heaven.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
3. Colossians 1:13 – Paul continued his praise to God in prayer for their    ** <u>earlier</u>**  deliverance in Christ (justification).
 
 
a. Colossians 1:13a – God rescued us from grave** <u>peril</u>** .    * For He delivered us from the domain of darkness,*  from Satan’s
    power and jurisdiction. Colossians 2:15
 
 
    1) Paul ** <u>used</u>**  the middle, or reflexive, voice for
    the verb * delivered* , communicating an intimacy and compassion.
 
 
    2) The grammar communicates a snatching or rescuing from danger with the
    goal of drawing the one saved ** <u>under</u>**  one’s personal
    care.
 
 
    b. Colossians 1:13b – Paul also praised God for their future inclusion in
    His eternal plan saying, “A* nd * [He]
    * 
        transferred us to the ** <u>kingdom</u>**  of His beloved
        Son.
    * 
    ” This statement is a reality to be accepted by faith and not an experience
    to be felt.
 
 
    1) This word * transferred*  METHISTEMI was used to describe the
    relocation of large ** <u>groups</u>**  of people such as
    captured armies or refugees from one country to another.
 
 
    2) History records that the Greek ruler Antiochus the Great, the sixth
ruler of the Seleucid Empire who ruled from BC 222 to BC 187,    * transferred*  METHISTEMI (same word, conveyed or transported) some
    2,000 ** <u>Jews</u>**  from Babylon to Colossae.
 
 
3) This is a beautiful description of our position** <u>change</u>**  as believers. God removed us from being    * in Adam*  and placed us * in Christ* . This is part of our
    inheritance as saints. 1Corinthians 12:22, Ephesians 2:1-6
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4. Colossians 1:14 – Paul ** <u>ended</u>**  his prayer of
    praise with a declaration of our gracious position as blameless. Ephesians
    1:4, 7
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:14a – * In whom we have redemption* … Paul burst forth
    in praise for the ** <u>price</u>**  Christ paid to purchase our
    spiritual freedom.
 
 
1) Remarkably, this is the current possession of    ** <u>every</u>**  believer in Christ. Notice that we have this
    redemption * in Him* , in Christ.
 
 
    2) In the here and now, as a result of our union with Christ, we have been
redeemed. By paying the required price, Christ purchased us out of the    ** <u>slave</u>**  market of sin.
 
 
    3) This is not a blessing we obtained because of something we did or must
    do, rather it is ours through the pure ** <u>grace</u>**  of
    God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 1:14b – …
    * 
        in whom we have redemption, ** the forgiveness of sins** 
    * 
    … Along with the apostle Paul, we should rejoice in praise and thanksgiving
    for the remission of our ** <u>sins</u>**  because of Christ’s
    death on our behalf.
 
 
1) Because the penalty for sin has been paid in    ** <u>full</u>**  on our behalf, God was able to forgive us
    eternally for all our sins.
 
 
    2) Although the phrase “ask for forgiveness” is a very popular phrase in
    modern evangelism, it is not a biblical requirement for salvation. If you
could be forgiven by simply asking for forgiveness, then    ** <u>Christ</u>**  died needlessly.
 
 
    3) When a person trusts in Christ, God recognizes Christ’s death as his or
    her substitute. God is therefore ** <u>free</u>**  to forgive
    without any pleading by the sinner since the sin penalty was already paid
    in full at Calvary.

# III. Colossians 1:15-18 – God’s Protection From Heresies: Understanding the Sovereign Authority of Christ
    
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** Introduction: Attacks on the deity of Christ** 
 
 
1. Philosophy: This error, referred to in Colossians 2:8, emphasizes
following human philosophy and secular knowledge. It deceives    ** <u>believers</u>**  into thinking that Christ is insufficient and therefore they need to figure out life by means of philosophy.
 
 
    a. Life based on philosophy places secular ** <u>logic</u>** 
    and human reasoning over and above a living, breathing relationship with
    Christ as found in Scripture.
 
 
    b. Solomon, the wisest human (other than Jesus Christ) to ever live (wiser than Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Buddha, Confucius, etc.), came to the conclusion that human philosophies and ideologies    ** <u>fall</u>**  miserably short of giving meaning to life. Ecclesiastes 1:2-3
 
 
    c. Christ stated that He is the only ** <u>way</u>** , truth and
    life. Peter added that all we need for life and godliness is found in the
    true knowledge of Christ. 2 Peter 1:3
 
 
d. Paul revealed in Colossians 1:27 that the mystery of life is    * Christ ** <u>in</u>**  you* . Colossians 2:2-3 further illustrates this truth.
 
 
2. Legalism: Colossians 2:16-17 portrays a blending of ritualism and law with the truth of Christ. This error produces a    ** <u>works</u>** -based Christianity that becomes nothing more than an oppressive system of legalism. Acts 15:1-11
 
 
    a. This ** <u>error</u>**  trades fellowship with Christ for
    legalistic regulations and religious rituals. Many churches fall into the
    trap of believing that godliness can be obtained by fulfilling rules and
    doing rituals rather than through a vibrant, faith-based relationship with
    Christ. Philippians 3:9
 
 
    b. When Christians are bound up in this error, they are typically
    characterized by rigidity, intolerance, self-righteousness and pride rather
    than by ** <u>humble</u>**  authenticity.
 
 
    c. Down through the centuries, this deviation has turned believers to
    things that are merely symbols of Christ but devoid of Christ Himself. You
    might say believers have focused on the ** <u>shadow</u>** 
    rather than the substance, or on the reflection rather than the reality.
    Colossians 2:17
    <br/>
 
 
3. Mysticism: Colossians 2:18 points out the error of* spiritual mysticism* . This error attracts believers to    ** <u>focus</u>**  on experiences and opens them to exploitation
    by deceitful leaders.
 
 
    a. This error enchants Christians by the fantastic, the inexplicable and
    the supernatural. It ** <u>trades</u>**  the authenticity of a
    faith-based fellowship with Christ for a “Christianity” based on so-called
    signs, mystical experiences and spiritual exploits.
 
 
    b. This deviation exalts the mystical. It often humiliates its adherents by
    foolish requirements. Sometimes it promotes a fixation on spirit beings,
    whether angels or demons. It boasts in ** <u>dreams</u>**  and
    visions (prophesies).
 
 
    c. This digression prefers miracles to the ** <u>Master</u>** 
    and seeks the gifts over the Giver.
    <br/>

 
 
4. Asceticism: Colossians 2:20-23 describes a Christianity based on** <u>human</u>**  determination through the practice of    * asceticism* .
 
 
    a. This error advocates the so-called spiritual disciplines and promotes
    self-denial as the ** <u>key</u>**  to godliness. It exchanges a
    sincere dependence on Christ with rigid self-determination.
 
 
b. Instead of pointing people to a consistent walk of    ** <u>faith</u>**  in order to live the abundant life, this error wrongly requires believers to try to better themselves through human effort and self-reliance.
 
 
c. This error detaches the believer from Christ, who is the true head of the church. It promotes reliance on human efforts rather than on the    ** <u>Christ</u>** .
    <br/>
    
 
 
    5. In a study of church history, we find that * Gnosticism* 
    ultimately developed from a ** <u>mixture</u>**  of all these
    false concepts. Unfortunately, we are not out of danger today. These
    heresies continue to daily assault the church.
 
 
    a. According to history, during the second and third centuries after
    Christ, Gnostics, in one ** <u>form</u>**  or another, embraced
    and promoted these deviations.
 
 
    b. We need to realize that the Colossian heresies remain a constant threat
    to Christianity. One or more of these areas have almost certainly affected
    every modern believer. Growth as a believer comes when God convinces us
    that ** <u>Christ</u>**  is all we need and He has all the
    answers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    6. So what do all these ** <u>errors</u>**  have in common?
 
 
    a. Each error gives a perfunctory allegiance to Christ but does not promote
    total dependence on His adequacy. Each one is first and foremost an affront
    to Christ’s sufficiency for ** <u>living</u>**  the abundant
    life.
 
 
    b. In all these errors the Christian is duped into living by human effort
    rather than
    * 
        by ** <u>faith</u>**  in the Son of God who loved us and
        gave himself up for us
    * 
    . Galatians 2:20b
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Ultimately these errors ** <u>demean</u>**  Christ’s
    sufficiency and lead to the false notion that Christ is not enough. We
    easily become like Esau and sell our birthright for a bowl of porridge.
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** Colossians 1:15-18 – Articulating the deity of Christ** 
 
 
1. Colossians 1:15 – As God-made-visible, Jesus Christ holds    ** <u>first</u>**  place in all creation.
 
 
a. Colossians 1:15a – ** * He is * ** * the image of the invisible God* … He is the greatest person to    ** <u>ever</u>**  emerge in human history. 2 Corinthians 4:4
 
 
    1) In the incarnation, Jesus ** <u>came</u>**  in God’s
    likeness. Jesus is both from God and God at the same time. John 1:1-2, 14;
    Galatians 4:4; 1 Timothy 6:16
 
 
    2) Since Christ is ** <u>God</u>** , He was able to become the
    revelation of God to mankind. John 6:46, John 14:8-10
 
 
3) Christ is the visible manifestation of the invisible God. Absolutely    ** <u>no</u>**  one else can validly make this claim. John 1:18
 
 
b. Colossians 1:15b –    * He is the ** image**  of the invisible God* … Christ is the ** <u>exact</u>**  exemplification of God the Father. Hebrews 1:3
 
 
1) Adam was created in God’s image and likeness. Even    ** <u>after</u>**  the fall, He continued to somewhat reflect God’s likeness, yet only Christ is the exact representation of God. Genesis 9:6, 1 Corinthians 11:7
 
 
    2) Christ is the express ** <u>image</u>**  EIKON of the
    invisible God.
 
 
    a) This word * image*  EIKON was used of Caesar’s image on currency
    (Lk. 20:24-25) and of idols representing men, ** <u>birds</u>** 
    and other animals. Romans 1:23
 
 
    b) A photographic ** <u>copy</u>**  of a document would be a
    modern illustration of this word. A photographic copy of a document becomes
    the exact representation (image) of the original document.
 
 
c. Colossians 1:15c –    * He is the image of the ** invisible God** * . Why was this statement about God being invisible significant, especially to the Colossian believers?
 
 
    1) The point made in this verse was ** <u>aimed</u>**  directly
    at heresy. Church history shows that as the heresies of chapter two
    advanced, Jesus Christ came to be viewed as one of many emanations of God.
    Christ was seen as a mere stepping-stone in a multilevel progression toward
    God.
 
 
    2) If Jesus Christ is indeed the visible manifestation of the invisible
God, we can come to know God by simply getting to    ** <u>know</u>**  Jesus. There are no steps needed and nothing is hidden in this process.
    <br/>
 
 
2. Colossians 1:15 – Jesus Christ holds first place as the    ** <u>premier</u>**  human of all time.
 
 
a. Colossians 1:15d –* The ** firstborn**  of all creation…*  The word    * firstborn*  PROTOTOKOS in Greek means first in order or rank. Even
though the word PROTOTOKOS can mean the firstborn in    ** <u>birth</u>**  order in a family, it is not restricted to
that meaning.
 
 
1) Historically a sibling ** <u>other</u>**  than the firstborn would oftentimes carry the title of * firstborn*  PROTOTOKOS.
 
 
2) Adam might seem to have originally deserved that    ** <u>title</u>**  because of his position in human history, yet Christ eternally predated him and has far superseded him as God’s firstborn PROTOTOKOS among humans.
 
 
b. Colossians 1:15e –    * The firstborn**  of all**  creation…*  means that He is the greatest man to ** <u>emerge</u>**  in human history.
 
 
1) This does ** <u>not</u>**  mean that the Father created Christ. John 1:1-3
 
 
2) Jesus Christ is called the firstborn of all creation because He    ** <u>holds</u>**  the premier position of first place among humankind. Acts 4:12, 1 Timothy 2:5
 
 
c. Colossians 1:15f –    * The firstborn of all ** creation** * … Jesus Christ is
    fully ** <u>man</u>** . The significance of the statement that
    Jesus Christ is * the firstborn of all creation * demonstrates that He
    alone is God’s preeminent man in human history. Only He holds this honor.
    Romans 1:3-4
 
 
3. Colossians 1:16-17 – Jesus Christ holds the    ** <u>place</u>**  of greatest honor on earth because He is the
    Creator of everything.
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:16 –
    * 
        For ** <u>by</u>**  Him all things were created, both in the
        heavens and on earth, visible and invisible
    * 
    … Our reaction to this statement might be, “Wait a minute? I thought God
    created the heavens and the earth.” (Gen. 1:1) If that is how you react,
    Paul succeeded in his statement. John 1:3
 
 
1) Colossians 1:16a – Jesus Christ is the originator of    ** <u>all</u>**  creation. …* by * (EN, denoting
    instrumentality)*  him all things were created.* 
 
 
    a) This verse begins with * …for by Him*  HOTI EN AUTO (Col 1:16), a
    phrase that expresses ** <u>cause</u>**  or purpose. It can be
    understood as ** because in Him** .
 
 
b) In other words, this verse gives us the reasons why Jesus Christ came to    ** <u>merit</u>**  the designation of firstborn PROTOTOKOS of
    all creation.
 
 
    2) Colossians 1:16b –
    * 
For by Him all things were created        ** both in the heavens and on earth** 
    * 
    … Christ personally designed and ** <u>made</u>**  the entire
    universe.
 
 
3) Colossians 1:16c – * For by Him all things were created * …    ** * visible and invisible* ** … He made everything in both
    the material and immaterial ** <u>realms</u>** .
 
 
    4) Colossians 1:16d – * For by Him all things were created * …
    ** 
        * whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities* 
    ** 
… Christ is the one who created all the hierarchy of    ** <u>spirit</u>**  beings in the celestial realms as well as
    all human authorities.
 
 
    a) Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Paul’s point is to show
    Christ’s ** <u>place</u>**  in the universe as Creator and
    owner, supreme above everything. He is over the unseen realms of angels and
    demons and the visible realms of humankind.
 
 
    b) Although Jesus Christ created spirit beings and their hierarchical chain
of command, He is not a part of that structure. As Creator, He is    ** <u>above</u>**  all hierarchy.
 
 
c) So did Christ create demons? No, He created holy and pure angels who    ** <u>became</u>**  evil and sinful when they willfully followed
    Satan in his rebellion. Even so, their hierarchical chain of authority
    remained intact. It did not change even in their sinful rebellion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Colossians 1:16 –    * All things were created through * DIA * Him.* 
    Jesus Christ is the ** prime <u>source</u>**  of every created
    thing. Hebrews 1:2
 
 
    1) Colossians 1:16e – …** * all* ** *  things… * The
    word * all*  PANTA is a comprehensive word used twice in this verse,
    clearly indicating that absolutely ** nothing**  in all Creation
    was created or ever existed ** <u>without</u>**  Jesus Christ.
 
 
2) Colossians 1:16f – * …were created… * In Greek, the verb    * were created*  KTIZO is an aorist passive indicative verb that
indicates these things did not create themselves or    ** <u>form</u>**  on their own, i.e., evolution. An outside
    force acting upon them created them. Jesus Christ decisively created
    everything.
 
 
    3) Colossians 1:16g – * …** through ** Him…*  Creation
    remains a testimony and proof of Christ’s monumental creative might.
    Nothing was created in any ** <u>other</u>**  way or through any
    other means than * through*  Jesus Christ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 1:16 – Jesus Christ is the    ** prime <u>purpose</u>**  behind all creation.
 
 
1) Colossians 1:16h –    * …all things were created… ** for**  Him* … * For* 
    EIS is a preposition that conveys purpose or ** <u>goal</u>** .
 
 
2) Colossians 1:16i –    * …all things were created… for ** Him** * . Everything was
    created to be Christ’s ** <u>own</u>**  possession and for His
    own good pleasure. Creation’s ultimate purpose for existing can be found in
    the holy, just and perfect counsels of its Creator Jesus Christ. Romans
    11:36, Revelation 4:11
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
d. Colossians 1:17 –    * He is ** <u>before</u>**  all things…*  Jesus Christ is
    the ** prime precursor**  of everything. He existed eternally
    before Creation was initiated. John 1:3
 
 
1) Colossians 1:17a – ** * <u>He</u>* **     *  is before all things* … Because of the grammatical placement of the
    pronoun * He* , this phrase could be understood as “He and no other.”
    John 8:58
 
 
    2) Colossians 1:17b – * He ** is**  before all things…*  We
    should note the use of the present tense word * is*  in this verse in
    contrast to the past tense was. He is (not ** <u>was</u>** )
    before all things. This accentuates the fact that Jesus Christ, as eternal
    God, always was and always ** is**  and always will be before
    all things.
 
 
e. Colossians 1:17 –    * …and in Him all things ** <u>hold</u>**  together* .
    Jesus Christ is the ** prime supporter**  of all creation.
 
 
    1) The thought of this verse progresses beyond the creation of all things
to the preservation of all things. By implication,    ** <u>without</u>**  Christ everything would simply
    disintegrate. Acts 17:28, Hebrews 1:3
 
 
    2) This verse indicates that Jesus Christ is not distant or detached from
    His creation. He is intimately involved in even the minutest affairs of
    this ** <u>life</u>** , including the cares of every individual.
    Psalm 139:1-18, Luke 12:6-7
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4. Colossians 1:18 – * He is also head of the body, the church* …
Christ holds first place of honor ** TO US**  because He is the    ** <u>head</u>**  of the church.
 
 
a. Colossians 1:18a – Note that ** * He is <u>head</u>* **     *  of the body* , not ** * a* **  head of the body.
 
 
    1) There is no authority in the body of Christ that is greater or can ever
    take the ** <u>place</u>**  of Jesus Christ. Ephesians 1:22-23
 
 
    2) Although the pastor and elders of a local body deserve respect, they are
    not head of the church; they are ** <u>under</u>**  the headship
    of Christ. 1 Timothy 5:17, 19, 1 Peter 5:1-5
 
 
    3) There are Christian groups that claim that their leader holds the place
    of Christ (Christ’s vicar). This is an ** <u>insult</u>**  to
    Jesus Christ. Colossians 2:18-19
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 1:18b – * He is head ** of the body** …* 
    Christ alone is the head of His body, the church. Revelation 19:7
 
 
1) Christ is the head of His body, which is one    ** <u>single</u>**  body made up of all Christians. 1
    Corinthians 12:12-13, Ephesians 4:15
 
 
2) In the human body, the body responds to the leading of the    ** <u>head</u>** . Colossians 2:19
 
 
    3) When the head is not able to correctly ** <u>control</u>** 
    the body, the body becomes dysfunctional or paralyzed, indicating serious
    disease or injury. This is true of Christ’s body as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 1:18c –    * He is also head of the body, ** the church** … * Christ
    is ** <u>first</u>**  in the church. Ephesians 1:22
 
 
1) Whether it is accepted or acknowledged, Jesus Christ is number    ** <u>one</u>**  in His church. The church ought therefore to
    respond to Him exclusively.
 
 
    2) Christ holds the ** <u>final</u>**  word of authority in
    regards to His body and bride. He alone maintains the ultimate right to
    decide if His church will continue to exist in a community or not.
    Revelation 2-3
 
 
5. Colossians 1:18 – …* and He is the beginning* … Jesus Christ    ** <u>holds</u>**  first place as the * beginning* .
 
 
    a. This is ** <u>not</u>**  saying Christ appeared in the
    beginning, rather that He is the initiator of everything that exists.
 
 
    b. It is one thing to be the first one created, but quite another to be the
source and reason for the existence of everything. Christ is the** <u>source</u>**  of all substance …    * for without him nothing came into being that has come into being* …
    John 1:3
 
 
    c. If you rewind the reels of history, you will arrive right at the feet of
    Christ. He is the ** <u>author</u>**  and Creator of all that
    exists.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    6. Colossians 1:18c – …* the firstborn from the dead* … Jesus Christ
holds first place as the firstborn PROTOTOKOS from among the    ** <u>dead</u>** . Acts 2:24
 
 
    a. Christ was the first human being to ** <u>rise</u>**  from
    the dead ** never to die again** . 1 Corinthians 15:20
 
 
b. Quite simply, Christ is the first person to ever fully    ** <u>conquer</u>**  death. Romans 6:9
 
 
    c. Christ did something no other person has ever done. He was not merely
    resuscitated; He came back from death to ** <u>never</u>** 
    again face death. Romans 6:10
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Death’s defiant ** <u>womb</u>**  gave birth to a firstborn,
    Jesus Christ. The word firstborn conveys the anticipating of more births to
    follow. Romans 6:5, 8; Revelation 1:5
 
 
1) Because He is the firstborn, the implication is that there is a new    ** <u>family</u>** . In fact, He was the start of a new
    humanity, the firstborn of the new creation. 2 Corinthians 5:17, Hebrews
    2:9-10, James 1:18
 
 
    2) It is because Jesus Christ conquered death and rose again that we have
    the confident expectation (** <u>hope</u>** ) that He can and
    will also raise us up from the dead in the future. Acts 3:15, Romans 6:4-5
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    7. Colossians 1:18d – A summary statement: …
    * 
that He Himself might come to ** <u>have</u>**         ** first place in everything** 
    * 
    . Our Savior Jesus Christ holds first place in everything.
 
 
    a. The word …* that* … in this phrase is a HINA clause, or a clause of
    purpose. This clause in Greek informed the readers that everything
    previously mentioned in verses 15-18 was mentioned for the purpose of
showing Christ’s authority – that He holds the highest possible    ** <u>rank</u>**  in every realm.
 
 
    b. ** How often**  should Christ * have first place*  in
    your life? Since ** * first place* **  PROTEUO is a present
tense, active voice participle the answer would be, “    ** <u>Always</u>** , continually, and right now.”
 
 
c. In ** how many areas**  should Christ    * have first place* ? “* In ** <u>everything</u>** * 
    !”

# IV. Colossians 1:19-29 – God’s Protection from Heresies: Understanding the Adequacy of Christ
   
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 1:19-23 – The adequacy of Christ in His work of
        reconciliation
    ** 
 
 
1. Colossians 1:19 – The wisdom of God in His choice of** <u>Christ</u>**  can be seen in this sentence:* For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness * PLEROMA    *  to dwell in Him* .
 
 
a. It was totally pleasing to the Father to have    * all the fullness ** <u>dwell</u>**  in*  Christ.
 
 
1) What this means practically for you is that you do    ** <u>not</u>**  have to go on a quest outside of Christ to find
    life’s answers. Colossians 2:10
 
 
    2) Everything you need for ** <u>godly</u>**  living is found in
    the person of Christ. 2 Peter 1:2-4
 
 
    b. Virtually all religions around the world claim to have completeness, or
    full knowledge, yet true fullness is found only in Jesus Christ. Everything
    necessary for understanding life ** <u>dwells</u>**  in Christ.
    2 Peter 3:18
 
 
1) In ** <u>Gnostic</u>**  writings the concept of    * fullness*  referred to a complex series of angelic emanations that
    were portrayed as levels of mediation between God and man. 1 Timothy 2:5
 
 
    2) Jesus, being ** <u>fully</u>**  God, expressed all the
    fullness of God in His human body; therefore, if a person has Christ as
    Savior there is no need for any supposed mediating agents, e.g., angels or
    prayers to Mary and/or to other departed saints.
 
 
3) Throughout the world and throughout history, the majority of    ** <u>cults</u>**  have rejected in some way or another the
    adequacy of Christ (His fullness), saying you need something other than, or
    in addition to, Christ. Matthew 11:27
 
 
c. Jesus Christ is the only human who has ever existed who could answer    ** <u>all</u>**  life's questions. You do not need to look
    beyond Him to make sense of life. Christ is truly all you need.
 
 
2. Colossians 1:20 – The indescribable task of reconciling    ** <u>sinful</u>**  mankind and a ruined creation to God the
    Father was given to Christ.
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:20a –
    * 
        And through Him to reconcile ** all things**  to Himself…
    * 
    There is only one person who is ** <u>able</u>**  to reconcile
    all of creation back to God and that is the man Christ Jesus. 1 Corinthians
    15:20-28
 
 
    1) The ultimate ** <u>goal</u>**  in reconciliation is to bring
    about a complete restoration of man with his Creator God. 1 Timothy 2:5-6
 
 
a) Back in the Garden of Eden humanity became God’s    ** <u>enemy</u>**  through sin. Jesus’ death for our sins and
    resurrection provided the means for us to be brought back into friendship
    with God. 1 Peter 2:24-25
 
 
    b) Even though ** <u>mankind</u>**  needs to be reconciled to
    God, when it comes to reconciliation, humanity has always been the problem.
    Man’s sinful pride has kept him from being brought back to God. Romans
    5:12, 16
 
 
    c) Although mankind is at ** <u>fault</u>**  for creating the
    enmity, God graciously solved the problem by providing Christ as an
    appeasing sacrifice.
 
 
    2) Reconciliation means that you completely ** <u>switch</u>** 
    from being an enemy to becoming a friend. Reconciliation creates true and
    lasting peace between former enemies. Romans 5:1, 8:1; 2 Corinthians
    5:18-20; Ephesians 2:16
 
 
    3) Since all human beings are at odds with God, each one of us needs
    reconciliation. Every human being is totally ** <u>sinful</u>** 
    and incapable of independently approaching the holy and sinless Creator.
    Romans 5:10, Ephesians 2:13-18
 
 
4) Jesus Christ’s substitutionary sacrificial death on the    ** <u>cross</u>**  provided the only adequate means of being
    reunited with God. Man, by means of philosophy, religious works, mystical
    experiences or self-reformation can never achieve restoration with God.
    Colossians 1:20-22
 
 
    5) God desired that ** <u>all</u>**  creation be reconciled to
    Him and that is what Christ came to do through His death on the cross.
 
 
    a) When this verse says God is reconciling all things to Himself through
Christ it does not imply that all people will be    ** <u>saved</u>** .
 
 
    b) The Bible never teaches universalism: the ** <u>false</u>** 
    belief that all people will be saved in the end. Revelation 20:11-15
 
 
    c) But God does ** <u>desire</u>**  that all be saved, and He
    worked, and continues to work, toward that end. 2 Corinthians 5:15, 1
    Timothy 2:4, 1 Peter 3:18
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 1:20b –
    * 
Having made peace through the        ** <u>blood</u> of His cross** …
    * 
    Christ’s death was a blood sacrifice that allowed for the reconciliation of
    all things to God. It could not be an animal, grain or oil sacrifice.
 
 
    1) In His death as a sacrifice, Christ did not die smothered, strangled or
    drowned; He ** <u>died</u>**  by means of the violent death of
    bloodshed in crucifixion. Matthew 26:28; Romans 3:25, 5:9; Ephesians 1:7;
    Colossians 1:14
 
 
    2) Hebrews 9:22 –
    * 
        And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed
        with blood, and without shedding of ** <u>blood</u>**  there
        is no forgiveness
    * 
    . Leviticus 17:11
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 1:20c –    * And through Him to reconcile all things to Himself* 
    * 
        …whether things on earth or things in ** <u>heaven</u>** 
    * 
    . This verse teaches that Christ was given the responsibility of the
    reconciling of * all things * to Himself. This includes earth with
    heaven (man with God), and heaven with earth (God with man). Romans 8:18-25
 
 
    3. Colossians 1:21-23 – The all-encompassing and sufficient nature of
    Christ’s ** <u>grace</u>**  is seen in the Father’s full
    confidence in the Son. The Father was pleased to entrust to the Son the
    responsibility of reconciling insubordinate humanity to Himself.
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:21 – In our former condition, because of our sin, we were
    outsiders and ** <u>aliens</u>**  to God.
 
 
1) Colossians 1:21a –    * And although you were formerly ** alienated** …* 
    Originally as enemies, we were estranged from ** <u>God</u>** .
 
 
    a) * Alienated*  APALLOTRIOO in Greek is from APO which is a prefix
    emphasizing ** separation**  plus the word ALLOTRIOS, a verb
meaning to ** alienate** . We were completely alienated    ** <u>from</u>**  God.
 
 
    b) Our original ** <u>state</u>**  of alienation portrayed
    unfriendliness, hostility and unresponsiveness in relation to God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2) Colossians 1:21b –    * You were formerly alienated and ** hostile in mind** …* 
    In our lost state, we ** <u>were</u>**  hostile enemies of God
    in our way of thinking.
 
 
a) The word * hostile*  ECHTHROS means hateful,    ** <u>enemy</u>** , adversary or opponent.
 
 
    b) As unbelievers, all our thoughts towards God were adversarial. This is
    the natural condition of ** <u>lost</u>**  humanity. Genesis
    6:5-6, Jeremiah 17:9, Matthew 15:18-20, Ephesians 2:1-3
 
 
c) Even for the believer, sin starts * in * [the]    *  ** <u>mind</u>** * . When we permit wrong thinking we
    become hostile toward God. Romans 8:7, Ephesians 4:17-19
 
 
    3) Colossians 1:21b – * Engaged in evil deeds…*  In our former
    lifestyle we were ** <u>evil</u>**  in our conduct. We were
    separated from God not only in our evil thinking but also in our actions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 1:22 – Conversely, now in our ** <u>new</u>** 
    standing we have friendship with God.
 
 
    1) Colossians 1:22a –
    * 
Yet He has ** <u>now</u>**  reconciled you        ** in His fleshly body**  through death…
    * 
    While in His earthy body Christ reconciled us by means of death. Hebrews
    10:10, 19-20; 1 Peter 2:23-24, 3:18
 
 
a) Paul stated the Colossian believers’ reconciliation as a** <u>fact</u>**  when he said, “    * He has now reconciled you.”*  * Now*  is the word NUNI, meaning
    at this very moment.
 
 
b) Your reconciliation is an act of restoration that happened at a    ** <u>point</u>**  in time, the moment you believed. Although
    you were alienated from God, at salvation you were permanently restored to
    your rightful owner. Romans 5:10
 
 
    c) Your reconciliation is based on the sacrifice of Christ on the cross and
happened at the precise moment you believed. It is not based on your good    ** <u>works</u>** . Colossians 1: 3-6, 20
 
 
    d) Since reconciliation is based on the work of Christ, it lasts forever.
    You are either reconciled or you are ** <u>not</u>** 
    reconciled. Your reconciliation does not depend on faithfulness after
    salvation. John 5:24, 1 Peter 1:3-5
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2) Colossians 1:22b – Christ reconciled us    * …in His fleshly body through ** <u>death</u>** * . In His
    death on the cross, in his physical body, Christ won our reconciliation. 1
    Peter 2:24
 
 
    a) It is interesting to note that here in this passage Paul pointed out
that our reconciliation is based on the physical, bodily death of    ** <u>Christ</u>**  on the cross and not merely on the spiritual
    aspect of Christ’s death. Hebrews 9:28; 10:5,10
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b) Gnostics propagated a ** <u>heresy</u>**  called Docetism,
    which proposed that Jesus Christ did not in reality have a material body.
    They hypothesized that He only seemed to have a material body and
    therefore the physical death of Christ had no value in our reconciliation.
    1 John 4:2, 2 John 1:7
 
 
    (i) Based on this philosophy, the Gnostics wholly rejected the incarnation
    and Christ’s literal ** <u>physical</u>**  death, as do many
    cults today. Acts 5:30
 
 
    (ii) The Gnostics based their heresy on a philosophy that all physical or
    material substances are inherently ** <u>evil</u>** . Therefore
    they erroneously supposed that if Christ had had a physical body He would
    have been innately corrupt.
 
 
    (iii) The Gnostics wrongly concluded that Christ did not actually die
physically since according to their belief He did not have a physical    ** <u>body</u>** . This heresy was of course an affront to the
    Gospel that includes the physical and spiritual death of Christ. John 1:14,
    1 Peter 3:18
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c) In relation to the doctrines of salvation, we should be careful not to
    exaggerate or understate either the physical or spiritual aspects of
    Christ’s ** <u>death</u>**  on the cross.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Colossians 1:22c – It was * in order to present you before him* …
    Christ had a specific ** <u>purpose</u>**  for us * in * 
    time as well as in eternity when He saved us. He did not save us so that we
    would stay the same. He wanted to change us and make us holy in our daily
    lives. Romans 6:22, 12:1-2; Ephesians 2:10; Titus 3:8
 
 
4) Colossians 1:22d – In saying, “    * present you before him holy, blameless and beyond reproach* ,” Paul
    was speaking of spiritual ** <u>growth</u>** , not glorification
    as this passage will bear out.
 
 
    a) In our future glorification, holiness, blamelessness and being beyond
reproach are guaranteed. These things will be true of every believer in    ** <u>heaven</u>** , but that is not what Paul was referring to
    here. Philippians 2:15
 
 
b) Christ saved us because He wanted to present us    ** <u>before</u>**  the Father in maximum practical
    sanctification (second tense salvation) in time. This is one of His goals
    in reconciling us to God. Genesis 6:9, Luke 1:6, 1 Thessalonians 2:10
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5) Colossians 1:22e – …
    * 
        in order to present you ** before Him**  holy and blameless
        and beyond reproach
    * 
    . Christ wants to ** <u>present</u>**  you in maximum practical
    sanctification (full maturity) before the Father in your daily walk.
 
 
a) * Before him*  KATENOPION means before the    ** <u>face</u>**  of, before the presence of, in the sight of,
    or before one as witness. 2 Corinthians 2:17, 4:2b; James 4:10
 
 
    b) The idea of being on display * before him*  (God) is sometimes used
in the New Testament to describe God's view of us    ** <u>here</u>**  and now on earth. 2 Corinthians 12:19, 1
    Timothy 5:21, 1 Thessalonians 4:3a, Hebrews 12:14, 1 Peter 1:15-16, Jude 24
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c) What this is saying is that God’s ultimate goal in reconciling you to
    Himself is so that Christ can present you before God in maximum practical
    sanctification while you are still ** <u>living</u>**  this
    life. John 17:17; Ephesians 4:13, 5:25-27; Philippians 3:12-15
 
 
    (i) This by no means describes or implies ** <u>sinless</u>** 
    perfection.
 
 
    (ii) The heresies that were developing in the Colossian church would have
    severely jeopardized the prospect of maximum practical sanctification in
    their ** <u>daily</u>**  lives (maturity).
 
 
    (iii) For this reason in verse 23, as we will see, Paul gave a condition to
    this goal, an “if” statement, to believers who were at risk of not becoming
    holy, blameless and beyond reproach in their daily living.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d) These three terms (* holy, blameless, and beyond reproach* ) all
    relate to Christian ** <u>maturity</u>**  and our daily
    sanctification and not exclusively to our future glorification. Job 1:1,
    Hebrews 11:5
 
 
    6) Colossians 1:22f –
    * 
        Present you before him ** holy** , blameless and beyond
        reproach
    * 
    … The adjective ** * <u>holy</u>* **  HAGIOS literally
    means different. Temples were described by this term, meaning they were not
    ordinary or mundane buildings. They were different in purpose and use.
 
 
    a) The New Testament authors further developed the meaning of holy HAGIOS
to describe ** <u>both</u>**  the ** condition**  and    ** position**  of the believer. The context will indicate which
    is being referenced. 1 Corinthians 1:2
 
 
    b) Believers are to be separated from ** <u>sin</u>**  and set
    apart for God’s specific use in time (Rom. 6:22, 2 Cor. 7:1) and will
    ultimately be separated eternally from sin and set apart for God’s specific
    use in future glory. Ephesians 5:25-27, 1 Thessalonians 3:12-13
 
 
    7) Colossians 1:22g –
    * 
        Present you before him holy, ** blameless**  and beyond
        reproach
    * 
    … * Blameless*  AMOMOS is an adjective that means not having any
    stain, ** <u>flaw</u>** , shame or disgrace.
 
 
    a) A in AMOMOS means without, and MOMOS means ** <u>spot</u>** 
    or blemish.
 
 
    b) In this context Paul used this term to describe how God wants to see us
    in our ** <u>lives</u>**  here below. Ephesians 5:27,
    Philippians 2:15
 
 
    8) Colossians 1:22h –
    * 
Present you before him holy, blameless and        ** beyond reproach** 
    * 
… * Beyond reproach*  ANEGKLETOS describes    ** <u>legal</u>**  blamelessness.
 
 
    a) ANEGKLETOS is derived from A meaning ** not**  and EGKALEO
meaning ** arraigned** , or    ** accused before a court of <u>law</u>** .
 
 
    b) A person who is * beyond reproach*  is ** <u>free</u>** 
    from indictment or accusations. 1 Timothy 3:10, Titus 1:6-7
 
 
c. Colossians 1:23 – What did the Colossian believers need in order to    ** <u>benefit</u>**  from the adequacy of Christ in relation to
    their sanctification? Well, let’s look at the information found in this
    verse?
 
 
1) Colossians 1:23a – * If indeed * (1<sup>st</sup> class condition)    * you continue in the ** <u>faith</u>** …*  Here Paul used
    a first class condition in Greek as a caution or warning. This statement
    could read * if… you continue in the faith*  and let’s assume you
    will.
 
 
a) In other words, he assumed his statement to be    ** <u>true</u>**  for the sake of argument. By this grammar he
    wanted to get his readers’ attention.
 
 
b) The Colossian believers’ practical daily sanctification was at    ** <u>risk</u>** . It was not guaranteed. By using an “if”
    statement Paul was trying to get them to stop and think.
 
 
    c) Although, by this first class condition the apostle Paul conveyed that
he ** <u>hoped</u>**  they would indeed    * continue on in the faith* , it was not absolutely guaranteed that
    they would. Ultimately their maturity depended on whether or not they would
    continue * in the faith* . 1 Peter 1:15-16
 
 
2) Colossians 1:23b –    * If indeed you continue in ** the <u>faith</u> ** * TE
    PISTEI… The phrase * the faith*  refers to the whole body of Christian
    truth (God’s Word) which was taught to the saints through the apostles and
    prophets. Galatians 1:23, 1 Timothy 4:1, Jude 3
 
 
    a) The apostle Paul ** <u>knew</u>**  the importance of sticking
    with sound doctrine. He knew that ** * if* **  we maintain
    the integrity of sound doctrine it affects our spiritual progress
    positively. 2 Timothy 4:7
 
 
b) He equally knew how it could affect us negatively    ** * if* **  we did not ** <u>stick</u>**  with
    sound doctrine. 1 Timothy 1:19-20
 
 
    c) It is important to understand that * the faith*  mentioned here
does not refer to our practical ** <u>walk</u>**  of    * faith* . Romans 1:17
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Colossians 1:23c – Let us now examine Paul’s caution about our spiritual
    growth.
    * 
        If indeed you continue in the faith ** <u>firmly</u>** 
        established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the
        gospel
    * 
    …
 
 
    a) The phrase * firmly established*  describes the fact that we have
    been solidly placed on a ** <u>firm</u>**  foundation and
    therefore have every reason to succeed in our sanctification.
 
 
    (i) * Firmly established*  THEMELIOO is a perfect tense participle
that stresses a stability that was established at some point in time in the    ** <u>past</u>**  and continues on into the present.
 
 
    (ii) This participle is also in the passive voice communicating that
    someone else, ** <u>God</u>**  in this case, provides this
    stability.
 
 
(iii) Therefore, * if indeed we continue in the faith*  based on the    ** <u>fact</u>**  that we have been * firmly established* 
on a solid foundation, we will be presented before the Lord as    * holy, blameless and beyond reproach* .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b) ** * If indeed you continue* **     *  in the faith …steadfast.*  The word * steadfast*  HEDRAIOS
    comes from the word ** <u>chair</u>**  HEDRA and conveys the
    idea of being settled or secure. A believer’s maturity depends on resting
    entirely, without budging, on the truth received.
 
 
c) ** * If indeed you continue* **     *  in the faith …not ** <u>moved</u>**  away.* 
 
 
    (i) * Moved away*  METAKINEO is a present tense participle stressing
that the road to maximum sanctification is to never    ** shift away from**  the ** <u>hope</u>**  found in
    the Gospel. Hebrews 3:6
 
 
(ii) The ** <u>three</u>**  statements    * firmly established, steadfast*  and * not moved away*  would
    have an emotional connotation for the Colossians.
 
 
    (iii) The Lycos Valley, where the small town of Colossae was situated, was
    a very geologically unstable ** <u>region</u>**  and could have
    been dubbed earthquake alley. At about the time of the writing of this
    epistle, that entire region suffered a massive earthquake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d)
    * 
        Not moved away ** from the <u>hope</u> of the gospel** …
    * 
    means to not shift away or be shaken from a solid stance on the hope
derived from the Gospel. Earlier we learned that the    * hope of the gospel*  is essential to maintaining fruitfulness.
    Colossians 1:4-6
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4) Colossians 1:23d – * The gospel…*  Paul spoke of the dynamic
    life-altering ** <u>power</u>**  that emanates from the Gospel.
    Romans 1:16
 
 
    a) * The gospel that ** you <u>heard</u>** …*  The Gospel
is a dynamic message. Remember that    * faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.*  The
    Colossians had not only heard the Gospel, but we know they also believed
    it. Romans 10:17, Ephesians 1:13
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b)
    * 
The gospel that you heard,        ** which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven** …
    * 
    The ** <u>Gospel</u>**  is a message that is designed by God to
    be infectious, untamable and explosive. Romans 5:18
 
 
c) * The gospel that you heard*  …    * of which I, Paul, have become a ** <u>servant</u>** * .
    Paul willingly suffered and sacrificed for the Gospel because he felt that
    investing in the Gospel was worth every ounce of his energy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5) Quick summary: Paul wanted the Colossians to be holy, blameless and
beyond reproach before the Lord in their daily lives, yet he    ** <u>knew</u>**  that it was contingent on ongoing steadfast
    endurance in the truths they had received.
 
 
a) ** * If* **  they did not continue steadfastly in the    ** <u>truth</u>**  they had received* ,*  they would not
    progress in their sanctification. They would not live holy, blameless and
    beyond reproach before God in their daily lives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b) In the next chapter, Paul presented ** <u>four</u>**  threats
    that oppose sanctification (phase two salvation). Any of these threats
could easily substitute for Christ and lead believers away from    * the faith* .
 
 
    c) Misunderstanding biblical ** <u>truth</u>**  will translate
    into inhibited spiritual growth. 2 Timothy 3:15, Hebrews 5:12-6:1, 1 Peter
    2:2
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 1:24-29 – The adequacy of Christ in the church, His bride
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 1:24 – ** <u>Paul</u>**  gladly suffered for
    Christ as he ministered to the church.
 
 
a. Colossians 1:24a –    * Now, I ** <u>rejoice</u>**  in my suffering* … Paul
    counted his suffering to be a blessing. 2 Timothy 2:10, 2 Corinthians 1:5
 
 
    1) * Rejoice*  CHAIRO is a ** <u>present</u>**  tense verb
    highlighting Paul’s ongoing and continual rejoicing as he suffered for
    Christ’s body, the church. Acts 9:4, Romans 8:17-18
 
 
    2) Paul rejoiced because of the eternal ** <u>value</u>**  of
    suffering together with Christ. 2 Corinthians 12:9-10, 1 Timothy 1:12-13, 1
    Peter 1:6
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 1:24b – …* in my flesh* … Paul experienced physical pain
and suffering for Christ and His church. Even while he    ** <u>wrote</u>**  this letter, the apostle was under guards
    twenty-four hours a day, suffering in chains as a prisoner. 2 Corinthians
    7:4-5, Ephesians 4:1, Colossians 4:10, 2 Timothy 1:8
 
 
c. Colossians 1:24c –    * I do my share on behalf of His ** <u>body</u>** * . Paul
    had a purpose in his suffering. In many ways and on multiple occasions Paul
    endured hazards including weariness, persecutions, and sickness as his
    contribution to the growth of the church, the body of Christ. 2 Corinthians
    11:23-28
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Colossians 1:24d – …
    * 
        in filling up what ** <u>lacks</u>**  in Christ’s
        afflictions
    * 
    . Paul considered his sufferings for the church his way of vicariously
    suffering for Christ.
 
 
1) Paul’s purpose in suffering was to ** * <u>fill</u>* **     *  up*  that which was still lacking in Christ’s sufferings. The
    phrase * fill up*  ANTANAPLEROO communicates the idea of standing in
    line and waiting patiently to do your part when your turn comes.
 
 
2) Since the enemy cannot get at Christ, he targets Christ’s    ** <u>people</u>** . 1 Timothy 3:12, Philippians 3:10
 
 
    3) The union between Christ and His body, the church, is so strong and
intimate that Christ takes persecution against the    ** <u>saints</u>**  as a personal injury. Acts 9:4
 
 
4) When you ** <u>share</u>**  in the    * afflictions of Christ*  through persecution it actually turns out to
    be intimate fellowship with Christ and great spiritual benefit for the body
    of Christ. * Death works in us but life in you* . 2 Corinthians
    4:10-12
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 1:25 – Paul took His ** <u>service</u>**  to
    Christ’s church seriously.
 
 
a. Colossians 1:25a –    * Of this church I was ** <u>made</u>**  a minister…*  God
    commissioned Paul as a minister DIAKONOS to serve the entire body of
    Christ. The qualifications of a good steward are faithfulness (Col 1:7),
    trustworthiness (1 Cor. 4:2), and a heart to serve. 2 Corinthians 3:5,
    Philippians 1:21
 
 
b. Colossians 1:25b – * I was made a minister * …    * according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me* . Stewardship
OIKONOMIA is a word that describes a superintendent who manages a    ** <u>household</u>** .
 
 
1) In those days the steward was typically a trusted and skilled    ** <u>slave</u>**  who would look after his master’s affairs and
    resources. Luke 12:42
 
 
2) In Paul’s case he was caring for the most important entity on earth, the    ** <u>church</u>**  of Jesus Christ. Since Paul’s day, nations
    have risen and fallen, organizations have come and gone, and yet after
    nearly 20 centuries the church marches on. Matthew 16:18
 
 
c. Colossians 1:25c –    * I was made a minister …for your ** <u>benefit</u>** .* 
    Paul felt directly responsible for the Colossian church. We observe that
    Paul worked, prayed, taught and lived for the sole benefit of God’s family.
    He was not serving for personal gain or glory. 1 Thessalonians 2:1-12
 
 
d. Colossians 1:25d – The apostle Paul worked very** <u>hard</u>**  in his service for the church to    *  fully carry out the preaching of the word of God* . Colossians 2:1
 
 
    1) He did not hold ** <u>back</u>**  anything that was
    profitable for them in His teaching. Acts 20:20, 2 Thessalonians 2:4
 
 
    2) He taught them the ** <u>whole</u>**  counsel of God just as
    we should in our ministry to the church. Acts 20:26-27, 2 Corinthians 2:17
 
 
3. Colossians 1:26-27 – Paul’s goal was to reveal and clarify God’s    ** <u>will</u>**  for the church.
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:26a – ** * That is, the mystery* ** 
    * 
        which has been ** <u>hidden</u>**  from the past ages and
        generations
    * 
    … Paul’s task was to dispel any mysteries surrounding the Christian faith
    by clearly teaching the truth.
 
 
1) Interestingly enough, terms like * mystery*  MUSTERION and* hidden*  APOKRUPTO were later misused by Gnostics to refer to their    ** <u>secret</u>**  ceremonies in their cult worship. They
    claimed that only the initiated knew and understood mysteries.
 
 
2) Under inspiration, Paul included these terms in his    ** <u>letter</u>**  to dispel mysteries and openly correct
    flawed understanding concerning how to live the abundant life.
 
 
    3) Without doubt, by means of the book of Colossians, the Holy Spirit
    preempted the Gnostic heresy as well as many related errors present today.
    It would be very wise for every individual believer to give special
    attention to the ** <u>truth</u>**  found in Colossians.
 
 
    4) The truth has already been revealed and the mystery dispelled. You do
    not need some ** <u>secret</u>**  supernatural revelation or
    some special new prophecy. You only need to know what has already been
    revealed in the Word. 2 Corinthians 11:2-4
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 1:26b –
    * 
The mystery ** which has been**         ** kept hidden from past ages and generations** …
    * 
    means that the Old Testament prophets and ** <u>saints</u>** 
    did not understand the things revealed to us by the apostles and prophets
    in the New Testament concerning the church. Matthew 13:16-17, 34-35; 1
    Peter 1:10-12
 
 
1) A New Testament mystery refers to openly revealed    ** <u>truth</u>**  that was not previously understood in the Old
    Testament.
 
 
    a) Romans 16:25 –
    * 
        Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the
        preaching of Jesus Christ, according
        ** 
            to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept <u>secret</u>
            for long ages past
        ** 
        .
    * 
 
 
    b) Romans 16:26 – ** * but now is manifested* ** 
    * 
        , and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment
        of the eternal God, has been made known to ** <u>all</u>** 
        the nations, leading to obedience of faith
    * 
    .
 
 
    2) In the New Testament Jesus Christ is ** <u>shown</u>**  to be
    both the revelation and essence of * the mystery* . Ephesians 3:1-10
 
 
    a) Ephesians 1:9-10 says, “
    * 
He made known to us the mystery of His will… that is, the        ** summing up of all things in <u>Christ</u>** , things in
        the heavens and things on the earth.
    * 
    ” This speaks of Christ’s role in our reconciliation.
 
 
    b) Colossians 1:26 says, “
    * 
        To whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of
this mystery among the Gentiles,        ** which is <u>Christ</u> in you** , the hope of glory
    * 
    .” This speaks of Christ’s role in our sanctification.
 
 
    c) Colossians 2:2 says, “
    * 
        That their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love,
        and attaining to all the ** <u>wealth</u>**  that comes from
        the full assurance of understanding,
        ** 
            resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ
            Himself
        ** 
    * 
    .” This speaks of Christ’s adequacy.
 
 
    3) Our understanding of * mystery*  in the New Testament revolves
    around the person and work of Jesus Christ.
 
 
    4) Jesus Christ is the summation of everything God wanted to accomplish.
    Christ was the ** <u>answer</u>**  to every dilemma man ever
    had. All the big eternal questions are resolved in Him.
 
 
    a) How would God reconcile Jews, Gentiles and even creation to Himself and
then to each other? The mystery was resolved in    ** <u>Christ</u>** .
 
 
b) How would God make His reconciled ones holy in their conduct and living?* Christ in us*  resolves the mystery of our being    ** <u>holy</u>**  in conduct.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 1:26c – * The mystery*  …    * has now been manifested to His saints* . Paul openly disclosed the
    whole ** <u>truth</u>**  to God’s people.
 
 
    1) What a contrast to false teachers who love to boast about being the only
ones to understand mysteries and gloat over having an inside    ** <u>track</u>**  with God.
 
 
    2) Rather than encrypt the message, true Christianity always seeks to make
    the ** <u>whole</u>**  church understand the mysteries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Colossians 1:27a – It was to us the ** <u>saints</u>** 
    * 
        God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this
        mystery ** among the gentiles** .
    * 
    What was so valuable about the mystery that God would take such great
    measures to reveal it to us who are Gentiles?
 
 
    1) Notice that when God revealed the mystery through the preaching of Paul,
    He willingly decided to include the ** <u>Gentiles</u>** .
 
 
    2) Note carefully that God did not merely reveal this mystery; He made
known    * the**  <u>riches</u> of the glory**  of this mystery* .
 
 
3) There are great * riches*  (PLOUTOS spiritual    ** <u>wealth</u>** , blessing and abundance) involved in
    understanding this mystery. Ephesians 3:8-10, Romans 11:33
 
 
    4) So, what is the mystery? What makes it so valuable?
 
 
e. Colossians 1:27c – The mystery is    ** * <u>Christ</u>* ** *  in you the hope of glory* .
 
 
    1) * Christ in you*  means you have His adequacy available to you
twenty-four hours a day. This is what makes the abundant    ** <u>life</u>**  possible.
 
 
    2) This is the unique aspect of Christianity that was never revealed in the
    Old Testament. This is what gives you a future ** <u>hope</u>** 
    of glory. John 7:38-39, Romans 8:23-24, 2 Corinthians 1:22, Ephesians 1:14
 
 
    3) The Old Testament did reveal a coming King who would set up a physical
    kingdom on earth. The Old Testament revealed that this king would be
    Immanuel, ** <u>God</u>**  with us.
 
 
    4) But the fact that God Himself, in the person of Jesus Christ, would come
    to
    ** 
        indwell <u>each</u> individual believer including the Gentiles
    ** 
    is not found anywhere in the Old Testament. This fact was truly an
    unrevealed mystery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
4. Colossians 1:28-29 – Paul described ongoing and extensive    ** <u>labor</u>**  in His ministry of revealing God’s mystery to
    the church.
 
 
    a. Colossians 1:28a – * We proclaim Him* … Paul and the other apostles
    proclaimed a ** <u>person</u>** , Jesus Christ, as God’s
    provision for abundant living. 1 Timothy 3:16
 
 
    1) Paul did not preach some program, system of religion, catechism,
    process, experience or philosophy as the ** <u>answer</u>**  for
    living a victorious Christian life.
 
 
    2) In the same way, we ought to proclaim dependence on Jesus Christ, the
    person of God’s mystery, as the ** <u>sole</u>**  fountain out
    of which we live the abundant life. John 7:37-39
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Colossians 1:28b – By …** * admonishing* **     *  ** <u>every</u>**  man,*  Paul sought to reveal the
    mystery to every believer. We can think of admonishment as teaching with a
    corrective twist.
 
 
    1) * Admonish*  NOUTHETEO is a present tense participle derived from
    NOUS meaning mind and TITHEMI meaning to place or put. Paul emphatically
    and repeatedly impressed the truth on their ** <u>minds</u>** .
 
 
    2) This is like a ** <u>parent</u>**  who brandishes something
    into a child’s thinking by repeated warning. Admonish is a stronger concept
    than mere teaching. 1 Thessalonians 2:11
 
 
    3) By implication, we as Bible teachers should persevere in the task of
    putting the truth of God’s Word into the ** <u>hearts</u>**  of
    our audience. We do this practically by repeated warning, caution, reproof
    and exhortation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 1:28c – ** * Teaching* **     *  every ** <u>man</u>**  with all wisdom* . Paul not only
corrected the church through ** admonishment** , he    ** taught**  everyone by instruction. 2 Timothy 4:2, 24
 
 
    1) Teaching is a ministry of explanation and clarification as opposed to
    the corrective ** <u>nature</u>**  of admonishment.
 
 
    2) Teaching is the process of systematically ** <u>laying</u>** 
    out truth.
 
 
3) Although admonishment is always important, Paul went a step    ** <u>further</u>** . He also ** * taught* ** 
    the whole church with great wisdom and careful instruction. 2 Timothy 4:2
 
 
    4) Through instruction he explained the ** <u>life</u>** 
    -changing objectives of the mystery * Christ in you* .
 
 
5) This is reiterated in the added phrase    * teaching …** with <u>all</u> wisdom** * . The teaching
    Paul described here is not just the transfer of knowledge. Wisdom actually
    applies the acquired knowledge. Philippians 1:9-10
 
 
    6) We discern a very practical ** <u>goal</u>**  in Paul’s
    teaching. His learners were not merely filling up notebooks with Bible
    truth; their lives were actually being changed by truth. John 17:17, Romans
    12:2, 1 Thessalonians 1:5-6, 1 Timothy 1:5, 2 Timothy 3:16-17
 
 
d. Colossians 1:28d – Paul proclaimed the mystery    ** * Christ in you* **  with a specific objective in mind.
He taught and explained the mystery in order to    * present ** <u>every</u>**  man complete in Christ* .
 
 
1) The phrase ** * every man*  ** PANTA ANTHROPON is found    ** <u>three</u>**  times in this verse and is a phrase that
    includes both genders, male and female.
 
 
    2) This phrase highlights the need we all have of understanding in a
practical sense what ** * <u>Christ</u>* **     *  in you*  really means.
 
 
    3) Christ lives in ** <u>every</u>**  believer but not all
    believers understand the life-changing significance of this fact. This
    verse shows how Paul put his life on the line to communicate to every
    believer this foundational truth.
 
 
    e. Colossians 1:28e – …
    * 
so that we may ** present**  every man        ** <u>complete</u> in Christ** 
    * 
    . Paul preached the mystery of Christ with the anticipation of presenting
    everyone complete and mature in Christ in his or her daily life. Galatians
    2:20, Colossians 1:22-23
 
 
    1) The idea of * present*  here is a flashback to verse 22 where he
    spoke of presenting us before ** <u>God</u>**  holy, blameless
    and beyond reproach in our daily lives as believers.
 
 
    2) Paul did not simply want to evangelize people. He worked tirelessly to
    see those who believe achieve the ultimate goal. He strove to present them
    to God ** <u>mature</u>** .
 
 
    3) So what does it mean to present someone * complete in Christ* ?
 
 
a) * Complete*  is the Greek word TELEIOS and means    ** <u>mature</u>**  or fully-grown. It describes something that
    has all its essential parts. What Paul was pursuing in his service was that
    every believer would ** <u>grow</u>**  and become fully mature.
 
 
    b) Paul wanted all believers in the church to ** <u>enjoy</u>** 
    the full richness of the abundant life and not to stumble through life or
    simply exist. John 10:10b
 
 
    c) He did not want even ** <u>one</u>**  son or daughter of God
    to fail to achieve spiritual completeness. Galatians 4:19; Ephesians
    3:14-19, 4:13; Philippians 3:10-14
 
 
d) Paul knew that completeness relied on how well they understood God’s    ** <u>will</u>**  for believers – the hope-giving mystery of the
    abundant life – the mystery of * Christ in you* .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
f. Colossians 1:29a –    * For this purpose I ** <u>labor</u>** .*  Paul was so
    absolutely convinced of the importance of the mystery he willingly gave his
    all for its expansion.
 
 
    1) The Greek word * labor*  KOPIAO means to work until one is
    completely worn out and depleted of all ** <u>energy</u>** .
    This word was used to describe exhausting labor. Paul did not give minimal
    effort; he strove to the point of exhaustion.
 
 
    2) Paul used the term ** * <u>labor</u>* **  in the present
    tense to communicate his present ongoing intensive exertions for them.
 
 
    3) In order to communicate * Christ in you, the hope of glory*  to the
    church, Paul gave it his all, even to the ** <u>point</u>**  of
    extreme physical exhaustion.
 
 
g. Colossians 1:29b –    * For this purpose I labor, ** <u>striving</u>** …*  The
    word * striving*  AGONIZOMAI was used to describe extreme effort
    especially through discomfort. We get our English word agonize from this
    Greek word* .* 
 
 
1) In ancient writings the word AGONIZOMAI described the    ** <u>extreme</u>**  exertions of those who contended in public
    sports, fights and wrestling matches. 1 Corinthians 9:25
 
 
2) AGONIZOMAI conveyed the idea of straining to the extreme to    ** <u>win</u>** . We might understand the meaning of the word
    when we compare it with the thrust of an athlete who, in order to win,
    strains on even while every muscle screams, “Quit.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    h. Colossians 1:29c –
    * 
Striving according to his power which mightily works        ** within me** 
    * 
… Notice the ** <u>sphere</u>**  in which God worked; it was    * within*  Paul. This speaks of God being at work for the good of
    others in and through a presented servant.
 
 
    1) God’s ** <u>work</u>**  through Paul was not primarily based
    on Paul’s abilities. It was based on God’s enablement. 2 Corinthians 3:4-5
 
 
    a) It was not ** <u>through</u>**  his superior education in
    Judaism that God worked, even though, to be sure, his education was
    extensive and impressive. Acts 22:3, Philippians 3:6-8
 
 
    b) God did not ** <u>work</u>**  through the apostle Paul based
    on his heritage, even though he was a * Hebrew of the Hebrews* .
    Romans 11:1, 2 Corinthians 11:22, Philippians 3:5
 
 
c) It was not because of his expert methodologies, his impressive    ** <u>mission</u>**  strategies or even his great work ethic
    that God was able to work through Paul. Romans 15:15-18, 1 Corinthians
    15:9-11
 
 
2) God was able to work through Paul simply because Paul was a presented    ** <u>vessel</u>**  God could freely use. God empowers presented
    people for effective service. Romans 15:13, 2 Corinthians 4:7
 
 
    a) This is something totally ** <u>foreign</u>**  to the
    experience of the unsaved.
 
 
    b) This is also something that ** <u>carnal</u>**  believers do
    not appreciate and seldom experience practically because they live relying
    on human wisdom rather than on the power of God. Jeremiah 17:5-8, 1
    Corinthians 2:4-5
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    i. Colossians 1:29d – Finally, a literal translation of this verse reads,
    * 
        “for which also I ** <u>labor</u>** , striving according to
        his working
    * 
    ** * ENERGEIA* ** 
     
    * that is working * 
    ** * ENERGEO* ** 
    *  in me in powerfully**  DYNAMEI** * 
    .”
 
 
    1) * Striving according to His working* … * Working*  ENERGEIA is
    a noun that means effective, ** <u>active</u>**  or pertaining
    to action.
 
 
2) * That is working * * ENERGEO* *  in me* … The verb    * working*  ENERGEO is a present tense, middle voice participle in
    Greek. It means that ** <u>God</u>**  was the One energetically
    at work, being effective and producing results in and through the apostle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) * Working in me, in ** <u>power</u> ** DYNAMIS* … The
    noun * power*  DYNAMIS communicates force, might or energy.
 
 
    4) The same nouns ENERGEIA and DUNAMIS, and the verb ENERGEO were used to
    describe the ** <u>power</u>**  God exerted in the resurrection
    of Christ from the dead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
5) Ephesians 1:19-20 –* These are in accordance with the ** working**  * ** ENERGEIA**  * of the strength of His might * ** DUNAMIS** * , which He ** brought about**  *     ** ENERGEO** 
    * 
        in Christ, when He ** <u>raised</u>**  Him from the dead
    * 
    …
 
 
    6) We can conclude that Paul strove ** <u>hard</u>**  in his
    mission efforts but only by actively receiving a constant infusion of God’s
    power. He was not trusting in himself. He was trusting in the power of
    Christ. Remember * Christ in you * is the mystery of God revealed.
    <br/>

# V.  Colossians 2:1-7 – God’s Protection From Heresies: Understanding the Mystery of Christ
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** Colossians 2:1-3 – Paul waged a war** 
 
 
1. Colossians 2:1 – Paul was engaged in a grueling and arduous    ** <u>struggle</u>**  for the churches of the Lycos valley.
 
 
a. Colossians 2:1a – * For I want you to know* … The opening word    ** * <u>for</u>* **  ties this section back to the previous
    passage. This is not a new topic but a continuation of the apostle’s deep
    concern for the churches beginning back in Colossians 1:24.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 2:1b – * How great a struggle*  conveys the idea of an
enormous contest, conflict or battle. Paul was aggressively    ** <u>fighting</u>**  for the lasting existence of the church in
    that region of the world.
 
 
    1) Paul was deeply distressing over them. The word * striving* 
    AGONIZOMAI in Colossians 1:29 has the same ** <u>root</u>**  as
    the word * struggle*  AGON in Colossians 2:1. We get our English word
    agony from this term.
 
 
    2) Paul used * struggle*  as a ** <u>present</u>**  tense
    verb, communicating his ongoing pastoral care and concern for the
    Colossians. Day in and day out, Paul passionately struggled for their
    success.
 
 
    c. Colossians 2:1c –
    * 
        How great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at
        Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face
    * 
    . Here we observe the ** <u>depth</u>**  of the conflict of soul
    Paul experienced for the Colossian church.
 
 
    1) Paul wanted the ** <u>entire</u>**  church body to know he
    was waging all-out war through intercessory prayer for them.
 
 
2) Remarkably, even though Paul did not personally    ** <u>know</u>**  most of these churches, he nonetheless prayed
    intensely for their spiritual progress. What a call to action for us today
    to pray even for churches we do not personally know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2. Colossians 2:2 –    * That their ** <u>hearts</u>**  may be encouraged* … The
    word * that*  HINA conveys purpose. Paul had a two-fold purpose in his
    intercessory struggle for the believers: 1) that their hearts might be
    encouraged, and 2) that they might attain to ** <u>all</u>** 
    the wealth which was already theirs in Christ.
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:2a –
    * 
That their hearts may be encouraged, having been        ** <u>knit</u>**  together in love
    * 
… The apostle Paul knew that when the body of Christ is    * knit together in love*  it will result in encouraged believers.
 
 
    1) The word * encourage*  PARAKALEO means to come beside and urge
forward. Encouragement comes from knowing you are not in the battle    ** <u>alone</u>** ; someone is at your side. Ephesians 4:15-16
 
 
2) Although we are many members in the body of Christ, Christ has only    ** <u>one</u>**  body. Christ wants all the members of His body
    to work together for mutual growth and then as one unit to be the pillar of
    light and truth in the world. 1 Corinthians 12:11-14, Ephesians 2:21-22,
    Philippians 1:27, 1 Timothy 3:15
 
 
3) Great encouragement comes in true Christian    ** <u>unity</u>** . Christians get involved in all sorts of
    dead-end activities supposing they’ll find inspiration for life. We must
    understand that we will never find true encouragement outside of Christ and
    His body. Philippians 2:2
 
 
    4) Unity has the power to ** <u>calm</u>**  and console our
    hearts. Paul understood the importance of unity so keenly that without
    hesitation he fell to his knees in spiritual combat, begging God for true
    unity in the body of Christ.
 
 
b. Colossians 2:2b – ** * And attaining* **     *  to all the wealth…*  Paul struggled in prayer for the believers to
    know and understand all the ** <u>wealth</u>**  that was theirs
    in Christ.
 
 
    1) In Christ we have been ** <u>blessed</u>**  with unfathomable
    spiritual wealth. Ephesians 1:3, 3:8-9; 2 Peter 3:18
 
 
2) A person, whether rich or poor, who comes to    ** <u>know</u>**  God’s mystery, Jesus Christ, as revealed in
    the Scriptures is a wealthy person indeed. Philippians 3:7-14
 
 
    c. Colossians 2:2c – …* that comes from the full assurance* … In
    contrast to the discouragement of uncertainty, God wants us to be
    encouraged, being ** <u>fully</u>**  assured of the truth of His
    Word and of His abundant grace so that we can come to truly bask in all the
    wealth that is ours in Christ.
 
 
    1) The phrase ** * <u>full</u>* ** *  assurance * 
    reminds us that we can be certain of the truth of God’s Word.
 
 
2) We live in a world where people jokingly say that nothing is sure except    ** <u>death</u>**  and taxes. Popular culture likewise teaches
    there is no absolute truth. John 18:38
 
 
    3) On the contrary, the cry of Jesus, the apostle Paul, and virtually all
    of Scripture is that you can ** <u>know</u>**  truth and that
    truth brings freedom. John 8:32
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. We live in a day when many teachers assert that it is good to live with
    a healthy ** <u>doubt</u>**  concerning salvation. To these
    preachers it is a good thing to have a degree of uncertainty and insecurity
    about your salvation.
 
 
    1) Some teachers say that you cannot ever truly know if you are actually
    saved until you die. They contend that if you continue faithful to Christ
    all your life then, and only then, can you be ** <u>sure</u>** 
    you were truly saved.
 
 
    2) Sadly, those who believe this become ** <u>guilty</u>**  of
    teaching a gospel of salvation by works.
 
 
    3) When you believe that good works play a part in your salvation, you will
be subjected to great uncertainty and insecurity and will not    ** <u>enjoy</u>**  the assurance Paul wanted the Colossians to
    possess.
 
 
    4) Paul stated that his goal was for believers to attain
    * 
        to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding
    * 
    . The purpose of the New Testament is not to ** <u>cast</u>** 
    doubts on our salvation but rather to provide solid assurance of our
    salvation. John 20:30-31, 2 Timothy 1:1, 1 John 5:10-13
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
e. Colossians 2:2c –    * …that comes from the full assurance of understanding…*  Paul used
the phrase * assurance of understanding*  to convey the idea of    ** <u>reason</u>**  based on logical deduction.
 
 
    1) Having a scriptural understanding of ** <u>Christ</u>**  and
    His salvation is absolutely essential for assurance. Without assurance of
    our position in Christ and the grace in which we stand, we cannot enjoy all
    the wealth that is ours in Christ. 2 Peter 1:3-4
 
 
    2) The ** <u>false</u>**  teaching infiltrating the church of
    Colossae mirrored much of what we see in churches today. We are told that
    Christ is not sufficient for our needs. We are led to believe we need a new
    philosophy, more rules and regulations, new experiences, or more
    self-control to dominate our desires.
 
 
    3) All these errors ** <u>remove</u>**  believers from Christ’s
    adequacy and diminish His value as the resolver of life’s problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    f. Colossians 2:2d – …
    * 
        resulting in a ** <u>true</u>**  knowledge of God's mystery,
        that is, Christ Himself
    * 
    .
 
 
    1) The unfathomable ** <u>riches</u>** , wealth and grace God
    has for us are found solely in the person of Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 1:3-4
 
 
    2) Paul struggled (Col. 2:1) and labored (Col. 1:29) in prayer for the
Colossian believers and the neighboring churches to    ** <u>truly</u>**  understand God’s mystery, which is Christ
    Himself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
3. Colossians 2:3a – Paul wanted Christ, God’s mystery, to be    ** <u>clearly</u>**  understood by the Colossians because all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are found only in    ** * Christ* ** . We need to know that the “secret” to
    spiritual living is found hidden in Christ.
 
 
a. Colossians 2:8-9 – In this chapter we will see that the    ** <u>secret</u>**  to godly living is not found in some human
    philosophy.
 
 
    1) A ** <u>new</u>**  philosophy or someone claiming to have
    higher knowledge could have easily bedazzled some first century believers.
 
 
    2) Even today some believers teach that life’s answers are found in a mix
    of Freudian thought and ** <u>biblical</u>**  truth.
 
 
    3) Since many say, “All truth is God’s truth,” some believers teach that
secular philosophy must be acceptable, but just because    ** <u>truth</u>**  belongs to God does not mean that the
    philosophy of this world is correct. James 3:13-18
 
 
    4) We can know with certainty that the treasure trove of wisdom and
    knowledge is found ** <u>only</u>**  in God’s mystery, Jesus
    Christ. Colossians 2:3
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 2:16-17 – The secret to godly living is not found in
    ritualistic or religious ** <u>legalism</u>** .
 
 
    1) Those who teach that you must keep the law to be a faithful Christian
and pleasing to God end up replacing a life of    * grace through ** <u>faith</u>** *  with human efforts.
 
 
    2) These individuals have not found Jesus Christ to be God’s unique
provision for godly living. They replace fellowship with Christ for a    ** <u>list</u>**  of rules and regulations.
 
 
    3) On the outside, legalistic Christians may seem to be doing everything
    right, but they are missing out on the joy of ** <u>true</u>** 
    fellowship with Jesus Christ. These believers tend to be mechanical in
    their Christianity while lacking the vibrancy of fellowship with Christ. 2
    Timothy 3:5
 
 
    4) The Pharisees lived barren lives. On the outside you could not find
    fault with their way of living, but they were ** <u>cold</u>** 
    -hearted, selfish and covetous on the inside and devoid of a real
    relationship with God. Matthew 23:25, Luke 11:39, John 8:19
 
 
    5) Legalists tend to be judgmental, ** <u>harsh</u>**  and
    unyielding, smugly feeling that they are the only ones truly right with
    God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 2:18-19 – The secret to godly living is not found in having    ** <u>mystical</u>**  experiences.
 
 
1) Those who teach this error replace a biblical relationship with    ** <u>Christ</u>**  for supernatural experiences.
 
 
    2) If they have to make a choice, they are be apt place higher value on
    their experiences than on the ** <u>Word</u>**  of God.
 
 
    3) If they have to decide between something they saw or experienced and
    what the ** <u>Bible</u>**  actually says, they usually go with
    the former over the written Word of God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
d. Colossians 2:20-23 – And finally the secret to godly living is not    ** <u>found</u>**  in personal asceticism.
 
 
    1) The ascetic Christian believes that by self-imposed harshness or
    personal humiliation he will gain greater spirituality and freedom from
    indulging in fleshly ** <u>sins</u>** .
 
 
2) Things like eastern yoga, transcendental meditation and special    ** <u>diets</u>**  do not hold the answer to true peace and
    prosperous living. The fact is that the reverse actually happens.
 
 
    3) As long as a believer continues to faithfully apply the pressures of
    asceticism, he or she can produce external conformity, but the moment one
    relaxes, the ** <u>flesh</u>**  comes back with a vengeance.
    Colossians 2:23
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
4. Colossians 2:3b – Christ is the person …** * in whom are <u>hidden</u> all the treasures* **     *  of wisdom and knowledge.* 
 
 
    a. There are incredible ** <u>riches</u>**  in understanding the
    plans and purposes of God. There is incomprehensible wealth in a complete
    knowledge of God’s infinite thoughts and insights stockpiled in knowing
    Christ Jesus our Lord.
 
 
    b. There is not one ounce of ** <u>wisdom</u>**  or knowledge
    that you need for living this life that is not already accessible to you in
    intimately knowing Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 1:3
 
 
    5. Colossians 2:3c – Christ …
    * 
in whom are hidden all the treasures        ** of wisdom and knowledge** 
    * 
    . Everything you need for abundant ** <u>godly</u>**  living is
    found in intimately knowing Jesus Christ.
 
 
    a. * Knowledge*  is God-given enlightenment to be able to understand
    His Word and ** <u>will</u>** .
 
 
    b. * Wisdom*  is the God-given ability to go on and practically use
    the knowledge of God’s Word and will in your ** <u>daily</u>** 
    living.
 
 
c. The believer who only superficially or academically knows the    ** <u>Lord</u>**  does not truly possess or experience this
    understanding. Christ is a person to intimately know not a school subject
    to learn. To know the Lord translates into a dependent walk of faith. Psalm
    9:10, Daniel 11:32, John 17:3, Hebrews 12:1-2
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** Colossians 2:4-5 – Paul warned of danger** 
 
 
1. Colossians 2:4 –    * I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument* 
    . Paul warned the Colossians not to be ** <u>tricked</u>** .
    Galatians 1:6-9, 3:1
 
 
a. Colossians 2:4a – Paul was worried the Colossians might be in** <u>danger</u>**  of delusion. …    * so that no one will delude you* … 2 Corinthians 11:3-4, 13-15
 
 
    1) The word * delude*  PARALOGIZOMAI is a two-part word in Greek. PARA
means ** with**  or ** beside**  and LOGIZOMAI means    ** to reason**  or ** to use logic** . You might say
    it means to add or combine something with ** <u>reason</u>**  or
    logic.
 
 
2) Deceit is exactly that. It is a clever combination of falsehood with    ** <u>good</u>**  reasoning.
 
 
    3) Even though in the very next verse Paul was complimentary of these
Colossian Christians because they were presently standing    ** <u>firm</u>** , it is clear from this warning that even the
    “strongest” Christian can be deceived and must therefore remain on guard
    and take heed to this warning. Colossian 2:5
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 2:4b – * With persuasive argument…*  False teachers
    often ** <u>seek</u>**  to win converts through wise-sounding
    arguments that are untrue. 2 Peter 2:1, 17-19
 
 
1) False teachers seldom come through the front    ** <u>door</u>**  proclaiming their unorthodoxies in clear
    language. Acts 20:29-31
 
 
    a) Instead false teachers use persuasive ** <u>words</u>**  to
    gain an audience with unsuspecting believers. They then stealthily steer
    them towards their devious goals. 2 Corinthians 2:17a; Jude 4, 8, 10-16,
    18-19
 
 
    b) Your real protection is putting on Christ as portrayed in the individual
    pieces of the ** <u>armor</u>**  of God. Romans 13:12-14,
    Ephesians 6:10-18
 
 
    2) The Colossians already owned the full treasure of God’s wisdom and
    knowledge in the person of Jesus Christ; they did not need to look beyond
    Him for acquiring ** <u>truth</u>** . Colossians 2:3, 3:15-16
 
 
    3) What kind of logic might charm you? What smooth sounding rhetoric might
    trick you? Acceptance of what ** <u>seems</u>**  to be right,
    without checking it against the Word of God, has led to the downfall of
    many. Acts 17:11
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 2:5 –
    * 
        For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in
        spirit…
    * 
    Paul used military lingo to compliment the Colossian believers on their
    readiness to ** <u>fight</u>** .
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:5a –Even though Paul was not physically present in
Colossae, in his ** <u>spirit</u>**  he was    * rejoicing to see [their] good discipline* .
 
 
    1) In using the term * good discipline * TAXIS, Paul employed a
military concept used to describe a well-ordered, descending-in-    ** <u>rank</u>** , combat-ready squadron of soldiers.
 
 
    2) Even though there were ** <u>false</u>**  teachers afoot, the
    apostle felt confident that the Colossians were battle-ready.
 
 
    3) Are we set for defense when it comes to false teaching? Have we adopted
    the modern don’t-rock-the-boat mindset of ** <u>tolerance</u>** 
    when it comes to doctrinal differences? May this not be the case.
 
 
b. Colossians 2:5b – Paul also rejoiced to see their** <u>stability</u>** .    * Rejoicing to see …the stability of your faith in Christ* .
 
 
1) The word for * stability*  STEREOMA means firm,    ** <u>solid</u>**  or stable. Originally the term described the
    military stance developed by the Greeks where shields were overlapped and
    spears extended as troops moved forward in unison.
 
 
    2) By using this term, Paul metaphorically described the unity of the
    Colossian church. He considered them a ** <u>firm</u>** ,
    unyielding and close-knit unit.
 
 
3) Their stability was based on their    ** * <u>faith</u>* ** *  in Christ*  not on their
    personal strengths. Paul perceived that they were firmly leaning on Christ
    and he knew this would ensure their ultimate victory.
 
 
    c. In summary, Paul rejoiced because he was sure the Colossian believers
    were on guard ** <u>against</u>**  false teaching.
 
 
1) They stood as a well-prepared and disciplined group of    ** <u>soldiers</u>** .
 
 
2) They stood with an arm-in-arm posture in their active    ** <u>faith</u>**  in Christ.
 
 
    3) Quite obviously Paul had done a ** <u>great</u>**  job of
    discipleship with Epaphras. As a disciple-maker, Epaphras had gone forth
    and duplicated Paul’s efforts in the lives of the Colossians.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** C. ** 
    ** Colossians 2:6-7 – Paul pointed toward Christ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 2:6 –
    * 
        Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him
    * 
    . This is the first ** <u>directive</u>**  given to believers in
    the book of Colossians.
 
 
a. Colossians 2:6a –    * As you received Christ Jesus ** <u>the</u>**  Lord…*  is
    a good translation of the Greek text.
 
 
    1) This verse should ** <u>not</u>**  read as the NIV, NET, and
NLT Bible translators rendered it:    * as you received Christ Jesus ** as**  Lord* .
 
 
    2) This would be the ** <u>only</u>**  place in the NT where the
    word “* the* ” (* ton* ) is translated using the English word
    “as.”
 
 
    3) We did not receive Christ Jesus ** as**  Lord, but we did
    receive * Christ Jesus ** <u>the</u>**  Lord* .
 
 
    a) Our salvation was not a promise, effort or ** <u>deal</u>** 
    we struck with God whereby we made Him Lord of our lives in order to merit
    salvation.
 
 
b) We received Christ as our Savior by simple childlike    ** <u>faith</u>**  in the person and work of Christ. Acts 16:31,
    Ephesians 2:8-9, John 3:16-17
 
 
b. Colossians 2:6b –    * As you ** <u>received</u>**  Christ… so walk in Him…* 
    Paul wanted the Colossian believers to continue to walk with Christ in the
    very same way they first received Him.
 
 
1) What we see here is that in the same way we received Christ by    **  <u>faith</u>**  at salvation we are now commanded to daily
    walk in Him.
 
 
a) According to John 1:12, to receive Jesus Christ is to    ** <u>believe</u>**  in His name. His name represents who He is
    and what He did. As Christ, He is the God-man who died for our sins and
    rose again the third day.
 
 
    b) Galatians 3:3 shows that we began our Christian walk by means of the
    Holy Spirit and therefore we are to continue on in the power of the Holy
    Spirit and ** <u>not</u>**  resort to the power of the flesh. By
    faith we walk according to the Holy Spirit. 2 Corinthians 5:7
 
 
c) Hebrews 10:38 shows that if we as believers pull    ** <u>back</u>**  from a walk of faith we displease our Lord.
    Hebrews 11:6
 
 
d) Romans 1:17 teaches that the justified person is to    ** <u>live</u>**  from faith to faith.
    * 
For in it the righteousness of God is revealed        ** from faith to faith** ; as it is written, “BUT THE
        RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.”
    * 
 
 
2) Colossians 2:6c – What did Paul mean by … so    ** * <u>walk</u>* ** *  in Him* ?
 
 
    a) The action verb * walk*  PERIPATEO comes from PERI meaning around
and PATEO to walk. Since Paul used the word * walk*  as a    ** <u>present</u>**  tense command it communicated the
    requirement to walk this way right now. Paul instructed the Colossians to
    daily walk with the Lord by faith.
 
 
    b) We are to go about walking with Jesus in the same way we first trusted
    in Him. We received Him by faith and that is ** <u>how</u>**  we
    are to now walk with Him. Galatians 3:2-3
 
 
    c) Every day you should wake up and walk about trusting Christ to live His
    life in and through you. In both ** <u>public</u>**  and private
    aspects of your life you are commanded to walk by faith. We are to daily,
    not just on Sunday, walk in this way. Galatians 2:20
 
 
d) We are to keep in step with the Holy Spirit,    ** <u>yoked</u>**  together with Him. Romans 8:13, Galatians
    5:16
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Colossians 2:6d – …** * <u>in</u>* ** *  Him* . At
    salvation all believers are placed into Christ. Galatians 3:27
 
 
a) When you became a believer, you were born again as a    ** <u>new</u>**  creation into the body of Christ. You are no
    longer in Adam. You now have a new identity in Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:17
 
 
b) Ephesians 1:3 – In Christ you have been ** <u>blessed</u>**     * with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places* . Colossian
    3:1-3
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 2:7 – Using the metaphor of a ** <u>tree</u>** ,
    Paul explained what your experience will be as you * walk * and mature
    in Christ.
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:7a – * Having been firmly rooted* … At salvation we
    became firmly ** <u>rooted</u>**  in Christ. Ephesians 3:17
 
 
    1) Because this participle ** * <u>rooted</u>* **  RHIZOO
    is in the perfect tense, it implies an ongoing present reality that was
    established at a past event.
 
 
2) The believer was rooted in Christ at the point of    ** <u>faith</u>**  alone in Christ alone for salvation.
    Afterward in daily living the believer continues on deeply rooted in Christ
    as His source.
 
 
    3) Being rooted speaks of stability. There is no greater stability than
    being ** <u>firmly</u>**  rooted in Jesus Christ, God Himself,
    who fully paid our sin-debt and rose again on our behalf. Romans 8:31-39
 
 
4) Being rooted speaks of nourishment. Truly our ability to stand in    ** <u>life</u>**  comes from Christ alone. He is the life-giving
    vine and we are the branches. Without Him we can indeed do nothing. Psalm
    92:13; Jeremiah 17:7-8; John 15:1, 2
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 2:7b – * And now being built up in Him* … You begin your
    Christian life by being rooted in ** <u>Christ</u>** . God’s
    maturation process is that you continue to grow up into Christ.
 
 
    1) God would have you expand ** <u>upward</u>**  through
    practical, daily, faith-based fellowship with Christ. Ephesians 4:15b
 
 
2) * Built up*  EPOIKODOMEO means to be built up in    ** <u>layers</u>** , one on top of the other. This is precisely
    how a tree grows. Every year a new layer is added on top of the old one.
    Usually there is about 1 month of new growth resulting in a new ring and
    then about 11 months of solidification.
 
 
    3) Although * built up*  is in the present tense, it is also in the
    passive voice. This means that not only is ** <u>God</u>**  the
    one who gives the growth, He is continually working to make you grow. 1
    Corinthians 3:6-10
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 2:7c –    * And established in your faith just as you were instructed* … As you
    mature, not only should you be built up and grow up into Christ, you should
    become established in your faith. This reminds us of a large tree standing
    beside the ** <u>water</u>** . Psalm 1:3
 
 
    1) We become firmly established in our lives by retaining what we were
    originally ** <u>taught</u>** . Galatians 5:7-8, Ephesians
    4:11-14, 2 Timothy 3:14-15
 
 
    2) The word * established*  BEBAIOO is a present tense passive voice
    participle that describes a believer who is in the process of becoming
    firmly ** <u>docked</u>**  in * the faith* , the body of
    truth we believe.
 
 
    3) Epaphras had apparently** <u> taught</u>**  the Colossian
    believers very well, but the present tense verb * established* 
    highlights for us the ongoing need of being daily established in the truth.
    Ephesians 4:22-24
 
 
    4) Ephesians 4:12b-13 – …
    * 
        to the building up of the body of Christ; ** <u>until</u>** 
        we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of God,
        to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the
        fullness of Christ
    * 
    .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Colossians 2:7d – * And overflowing with gratitude* . The metaphor
    now pictures a ** <u>fruit</u>** -bearing tree. We come to
    experience a bumper-crop of gratitude.
 
 
    1) The word * overflowing*  PERISSEUO means abounding, spilling over,
    or ** <u>filled</u>**  to the brim. As we walk by faith we can
    expect to burst with gratitude.
 
 
2) This thanksgiving speaks of internal transformation, a true    ** <u>mark</u>**  of someone who is walking by faith and growing
    in Christ.
 
 
3) Pseudo-spirituality, created by the heresies we are about to see,    ** <u>changes</u>**  our actions but not our attitudes.
 
 
    4) The four heresies of Colossians 2 are merely external modifications. On
    the contrary, the metaphor of ** <u>growth</u>**  as shown in
    this passage deals with internal change that results in fruit-bearing. This
    is what God wants and this is only available in Christ, God’s revealed
    mystery. 1 Timothy 3:16

# VI. Colossians 2:8-23 – Examining the Four Heresies of Colossae
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** Colossians 2:8-10 – Philosophy, the first heresy** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 2:8 – Paul ** <u>warned</u>**  of the danger of
    philosophy. Proverbs 1:1-7
 
===
a. Colossians 2:8a – The phrase …* see to it* … is a    ** <u>present</u>**  tense command followed by the Greek
    negation ME giving the command an emphasis akin to, “Watch out!” Since the
    command is in the active voice, it was their personal responsibility to
    have ongoing vigilance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
=== 
b. Colossians 2:8b –    * See to it that no one takes you ** <u>captive</u>** * …
    is language that was used to describe a person taken as a prisoner of war.
    In those days, being a POW meant you’d eventually be sold and become
    someone’s slave.
 
===
1) Most casualties or converts to cults come out of    ** <u>churches</u>**  rather than directly from the unsaved
    world.
 
 
    2) In other words, unsuspecting and unguarded Christians easily fall
    captive to ** <u>cults</u>** . You must not forget that you are
    in a deadly battle. You should not fall asleep in your good profession of
    Christ or get complacent in your faith. That is dangerous. 1 Timothy
    1:18-20
 
 
    c. Colossians 2:8c –
    * 
        See to it that no one takes you captive ** <u>through</u>** 
        philosophy
    * 
    . The heresy of philosophy is the error of falling prey to a deceptive
    human viewpoint.
 
===
    1) In Greek the word * philosophy*  PHILOSOPHIA is a compound word
derived from PHILOS friend and SOPHIA wisdom. It literally means the    ** <u>love</u>**  of wisdom or science. This is the only
    occurrence of this word in the Bible.
 
 
2) Thayer’s Lexicon defines philosophy as the “love and    ** <u>pursuit</u>**  of wisdom.” Thayer stated that philosophy
    was used in Greek writings to describe skill in, or zeal for, any art,
    science or branch of knowledge.
===
 
    3) Interestingly, Paul’s singular use of the word came with a negative
    overtone describing worthless human speculation and misleading substitutes
    for ** <u>truth</u>** .
 
 
    4) It would be good here to consider the ** <u>major</u>** 
    schools of philosophy embraced in Roman society at the time. These
    philosophies are still very prevalent in one form or another in our world
    today.
===
 
    a) ** <u>Five</u>**  schools of philosophy were important or
    prominent in the time of Paul’s writings. They were Cynicism, Hedonism,
    Skepticism, Stoicism and Epicureanism.
 
 
b) By the time of Paul, Greek philosophy had undergone a    ** <u>change</u>**  in focus from what ancient philosophers
    wanted to understand. Originally they tried to understand the primary
    principles of existence, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time and
    space (metaphysics).
    <br/>
    <br/>
===
 
    c) However, in the days of the writing of the New Testament, philosophers
    were more interested in knowing how to be dignified and live a good life
    than to understand the basis of life itself. Their focus shifted to
    understanding issues of ** <u>ethics</u>** , virtue and quality
    of character.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d) Two schools of philosophy ought to be considered because their devotees
    are mentioned in Acts 17:18. These philosophers ridiculed Paul’s teachings
    about the Christ and the resurrection of the ** <u>dead</u>** .
    <br/>
    <br/>
===
 
    (i) The first school of philosophy was Stoicism.
 
 
    (a) Zeno of Citium founded stoicism in Athens circa 300 BC. This teaching
claimed that wisdom was gained by abstinence from    ** <u>passion</u>** .
 
 
    (b) Stoics believed that wisdom was attainable through meditation and an
    indifference to ** <u>pain</u>**  and pleasure.
 
===
(c) Stoicism postulated that wisdom occurs when    ** <u>reason</u>**  controls passions. Conversely evil occurs
    when passion controls a person.
 
 
    (d) Interestingly, Stoic philosophies ** <u>led</u>**  to
    virtuous living by relying on self-discipline and self-restraint.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
===
    (ii) The second school of philosophy was Epicureanism.
 
 
    (a) Generally Epicureanism, established in Athens circa BC 300 by Epicurus,
had little concern for religion. To them religion and ignorance went    ** <u>hand</u>**  in hand.
 
 
(b) According to their reasoning, gods existed, but    ** <u>far</u>**  off in space, and they were generally
    disinterested in humanity.
 
 
    (c) Epicureans did not believe in ** <u>life</u>**  after death,
    making them the Greek version of Jewish Sadducees.
===
    (d) Epicureanism was typically the philosophy of the nobility who wanted to
    be deemed ** <u>wise</u>**  and virtuous in public, yet in their
    private lives they practiced hedonism, or carnal pleasure, since ultimately
    happiness was the true goal of their lives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
(iii) Even though these two philosophies were based on    ** <u>vastly</u>**  different paradigms, their outworking in
    society was similar. In public life, both Stoics and Epicureans sought to
    be virtuous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5) Philosophy does not have the ** <u>Word</u>**  of God as its
    authority. Ultimately all philosophies seek to explain or understand life
    apart from Christ as our source and adequacy.
 
 
    a) Because of this sad fact, without doubt any human philosophy will
    ultimately lead you ** <u>away</u>**  from God. Instead of
    leading you to rely on God, it will lead you to rely on the wisdom of men
    for life’s answers.
 
 
b) It is important to ** <u>note</u>**  that    ** * philosophy* ** , not ** knowledge** , is
    what is condemned here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
d. Colossians 2:8d – According to Paul, philosophy is    ** * <u>empty</u>* ** .
 
 
1) When it came to explaining the issues of life, Paul called philosophy    * empty*  * deception* . In Greek the word * empty*  KENOS
    means ** <u>without</u>**  substance; it describes the hollow or
    foolish distortion that leads to disillusionment. Philosophy cannot satisfy
    the nagging questions of life.
 
 
2) In the Phillips New Testament this word was translated as    * high-sounding ** <u>nonsense</u>** * . That’s a pretty
    good description.
 
 
    3) In Deuteronomy 32:45-47 when relating God’s words to the Israelites,
    Moses said, “
    * 
For it is not an idle word for you; indeed it is your        ** <u>life</u>** 
    * 
    .” God’s Word is not without substance. Quite the contrary. God’s Word
    gives life. Psalm 119:105, Proverbs 6:23, 2 Peter 1:19
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
e. Colossians 2:8e – Philosophy is not only * empty,*  it is    ** <u>deceptive</u>** .
 
 
    1) Philosophy is described as * deception*  APETE. Deception is that
    which gives a ** <u>false</u>**  impression or is unreliable or
    corrupt.
 
 
    2) The word * deception*  APETE means to ** <u>trick</u>** 
    . Philosophy’s * empty deception*  aptly describes mankind’s enticing
    words of intellectualism.
 
 
3) Paul, being well-acquainted with the philosophies of his    ** <u>day</u>** , regarded them with suspicion and rejection. He
    was quick to call them deceptive and misleading.
 
 
    4) What place does philosophy hold in your life? Are you getting your
    understanding for life from philosophy’s human viewpoints found in
    self-help books, media, the Internet, the education system, or from the
    precious Word of Christ? Colossians 3:15-16
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2. Colossians 2:8 – Paul showed why philosophy was    ** <u>deficient</u>**  and to be decisively rejected.
 
 
a. Colossians 2:8f – We ought to reject philosophy because of its** <u>source</u>** . Philosophy is …    * according to the traditions of men* .
 
 
    1) Paul knew that the philosophy of his day and its adherents, e.g.,
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, followed the traditions of    ** <u>men</u>** .
 
 
    2) The Greek culture’s ancestors had ** <u>passed</u>**  down
    philosophy from generation to generation in a written format. So when Paul
    described where philosophy originated, he was quick to show that its source
    was man, not God. James 3:13-18
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) 1 Corinthians 1:19-20 –
    * 
        For it is written, "I WILL ** <u>DESTROY</u>**  THE WISDOM
        OF THE WISE, AND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE." Where
        is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age?
        Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world
    * 
    ?
 
 
    4) 1 Corinthians 1:21 – Fo
    * 
        r since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come
        to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the
        message preached to ** <u>save</u>**  those who believe
    * 
    .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5) 1 Corinthians 2:6 –
    * 
        Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however,
        not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away;
        but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God
        predestined before the ages to our ** <u>glory</u>** 
    * 
    .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Colossians 2:8g – We should reject philosophy because of its** <u>substance</u>** . Philosophy is …    * according to the elementary principles of this world* .
 
 
1) The word * elementary*  STOICHEION comes from a word meaning to    ** <u>line</u>**  up or do the ABC's.
 
 
    2) Philosophy is a failed method used by the world to get people to behave.
    It comes down to human effort and the futility of stopping the flesh by
    merely saying no to ** <u>sin</u>** . Colossians 2:23
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Philosophy is the world’s ** <u>way</u>** , not God’s way, of
    changing people and society. This way of control is very basic like saying,
    “no” to a child.
 
 
4) The unsaved by default live their lives according to philosophy’s    * empty deception, traditions and elementary principles* . Saved
    people who walk according to the flesh typically live their lives by these
    very same principles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
5) This is why Paul so strongly and clearly** <u>rejected</u>**  philosophy as an empty substitute for    * Christ in you* , God’s mystery provision for living a spiritual
    life. Paul told the Colossian believers to learn to walk by faith,
    dependent on Christ Jesus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Colossians 2:8h – Finally we are to reject philosophy because of its
distorted ** <u>shift</u>**  in focus. Philosophy is    * not according to Christ* .
 
 
    1) For scores of Christians the logic of philosophy either replaces Christ
    or ** <u>makes</u>**  Him too insignificant or insufficient for
    explaining life or even resolving life’s problems. Therefore, as Paul says,
    philosophy is * not according to Christ* .
 
 
    2) Philosophy fails ** <u>first</u>**  and foremost because it
    diminishes Jesus Christ as the answer and dismisses or displaces Him as
    inadequate.
 
 
3) The fact is, philosophy always disappoints. It leaves you looking for    ** <u>more</u>** . Yet in Jesus Christ every believer has
    everything necessary for life and godliness. 2 Peter 1:3-4, 3:17-18
 
 
    4) Any time anyone tells you they have the answer to life, if their answer
    does not lead to Jesus Christ as ** <u>able</u>**  and adequate,
    it is mere philosophy and will in the end fail you, guaranteed. Romans
    1:21-22
 
 
5) Christ is God’s one and only treasure chest filled with    ** * <u>all</u>* ** *  wisdom and understanding.* 
    John 10:10, Colossians 2:3
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 2:9-15 – Understanding Christ’s person and work safeguards
        against heresy
    ** 
 
 
1. Colossians 2:9-10 – Understanding Christ as God’s provision    ** <u>guards</u>**  us against the heresy of philosophy.
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:9 – We choose Christ over philosophy because as God
    incarnate He alone is adequate for every need.
    * 
        For in Him all the fullness of Deity ** <u>dwells</u>** 
    * 
    (present tense)*  in bodily form* . Colossian 1:19
 
 
1) First we should understand that the phrase ** * in* **     *  ** <u>Him</u>** *  is in an emphatic position in the
    Greek sentence deepening the contrast we find between Jesus Christ and any
    substitute.
 
 
    2) A philosopher may ** <u>offer</u>**  you superior knowledge,
    but no one other than Jesus Christ can offer himself as the God-man.
 
 
    3) The fullness or completeness of Christ communicates to us that
    ultimately He has all the ** <u>answers</u>**  to life’s
    perplexities. Fullness is found in no one other than Jesus Christ, so if
    you want answers to life’s questions, look no further. If you trust in
    philosophy, you will come away disappointed. Romans 9:33b
 
 
    4) Jesus Christ is superior to any philosophy because He is God come in
    human flesh, and thankfully He now ** <u>abides</u>**  forever
    in us. Colossians 1:28
 
 
    5) The term * fullness*  PLEROMA was originally used by cultic
    religions to describe the ** <u>sum</u>**  total of the
    qualities of their false deity. Eventually under Gnosticism false teachers
    taught that Jesus Christ was merely one of many stepping-stones or
    intermediaries leading to * fullness* .
 
 
    6) Obviously this ** <u>error</u>**  was an affront to Christ’s
    adequacy for providing us with the abundant life. John 10:10
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Colossians 2:10a –    * And in Him you have been ** <u>made</u>**  complete* . We
    choose Christ over philosophy because in Him, as His people, we actually
    lack nothing.
 
 
    1) This truth ought to be trumpeted all throughout Christendom. Our
position in Christ secures for us the blessing of lacking    ** <u>nothing</u>**  necessary for abundant and holy living.
 
 
a) As we have observed, the verb * complete*  PLEROO means to make    ** <u>full</u>** . The fact that it is in the perfect tense in
    Greek conveys that although the filling already took place in the past, it
    has an ongoing effect all the way to the present.
 
 
b) In other words, we ** <u>remain</u>**  continually    * complete in Him* .
 
 
    2) Through the ** <u>true</u>**  knowledge of Jesus Christ, we
    have all we need for life and godliness. There is no such thing as a
    second-rate, less-than-complete believer. 2 Peter 1:3-4
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Colossians 2:10b – Why choose Christ over philosophy? Because “
    * 
        [Christ] is the ** <u>head</u>**  over all rule and
        authority
    * 
    .”
 
 
    1) There are ** <u>many</u>**  supposed authorities that tell
    you Christ is not sufficient. This verse tells us that Christ is over all
    the so-called authorities that say such vanities. Wise men can tell you all
    sorts of lofty falsehoods, but the greatest authority of all, Jesus Christ,
    has the final word.
 
 
    2) ** <u>Christ</u>**  is truly supreme. He alone is over, and
    not part of, the angelic, or supposed enlightened, realm. As God, He is
    Creator, and as man, He is the firstborn, the premiere man of all time.
 
 
    3) Christ is supreme beyond measure, above all authorities whether angelic
or human; so don’t look to human philosophy or anyone who    ** <u>claims</u>**  to have the answers. Look to Christ alone
    and allow His Word to abundantly dwell within you. Colossians 3:16
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 2:11-13a – We ought to understand how our identification with
    Christ and not philosophy gives us true ** <u>victory</u>** 
    over the sin nature.
 
 
a. Colossians 2:11a – * And in Him…*  Notice the use of the phrase    * in Him*  in this verse. This statement reminds us all over again of
our identification with Jesus Christ. All believers are positionally    ** <u>found</u>**  in Christ: * in Him* . Ephesians 1:3
 
 
b. Colossians 2:11b – ** * You were also circumcised* **     *  with a circumcision made without hands… * By means of a spiritual
    operation ** <u>done</u>**  in you at the moment of your
    salvation, you now have true spiritual freedom from domination by your
    flesh.
 
 
    1) Physical circumcision separated the Israelite nation from other nations,
    making it unique, set ** <u>apart</u>**  unto God. In this
    physical surgery there was a cutting away of unnecessary skin, a separation
    in the flesh of the physical body.
 
 
    2) We recall that physical circumcision was a ** <u>sign</u>** 
    of the covenant between God and Abraham and between God and Abraham’s
    physical descendants.
 
 
    3) We know from Scripture that physical circumcision has never been a
    requirement for Christians for either salvation or sanctification, but
    spiritually speaking ** <u>every</u>**  Christian has been
    circumcised. Philippians 3:3
 
 
c. Colossians 2:11c –    * You were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands* .
    At salvation we ** <u>had</u>**  the spiritual operation of
    circumcision done in us. Here we understand Paul to be talking about the
    nonliteral circumcision that is true of every believer and occurs at the
    moment of salvation. Romans 2:29
 
 
    1) * You were also circumcised* … The believer’s circumcision is given
    as a ** <u>fact</u>** .
 
 
    2) * …with a circumcision made without hands* . We can see that it was
    done ** <u>without</u>**  human doctors.
 
 
a) Grammatically this circumcision is in the passive    ** <u>voice</u>**  showing that it was done to the believer and
    not by the believer.
 
 
    b) Since this is said to be true of ** <u>all</u>**  believers
and was done without human hands, we conclude that it is    ** spiritual circumcision**  done by God at the point of
    salvation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
d. Colossians 2:11d – ** * In the removal* **     *  of the body of the flesh* … What happened in this circumcision and
    what is its significance? The flesh, or our ** <u>sin</u>** 
    nature, was surgically severed from us and will eventually be destroyed.
    The Great Physician did this great work.
 
 
    1) The word * removal*  APEKDUSIS in Greek is a noun which means to
wholly put aside. This word was used to describe something set aside    ** <u>never</u>**  to be used again – like one might do with a
    worn out garment.
 
 
2) The word * removal*  connotes separation but    ** <u>not</u>**  obliteration or eradication.
 
 
    3) In circumcision, the flesh of the foreskin is surgically severed from
    the human body and laid ** <u>aside</u>** . Later this piece of
    flesh is discarded.
 
 
4) In spiritual circumcision, the sin nature was severed, losing    ** <u>direct</u>**  connection to us. Eventually in the rapture
    when our bodies are changed forever, the sin nature that was cut off at
    salvation will be completely eliminated.
 
 
    5) For now we are to understand that the sin nature’s direct impact and
    effect in our ** <u>lives</u>**  has been cut off. This is of
    great significance and is another way of affirming Romans 6:2, 6, 10-11.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
e. Colossians 2:11e –    * In the removal ** of the body of the flesh** * … In the
    Scriptures, the word for body SOMA normally refers to the actual physical
human body, yet this is obviously ** not**  saying our    ** <u>human</u>**  body was removed or laid aside.
 
 
1) A secondary meaning of the word body SOMA is the** substance or <u>core</u>**  of an object in contrast to its    ** shadow or silhouette** . This is the meaning Paul used here.
 
 
2) In verse 17 there is an example of Paul using this secondary meaning of    ** <u>body</u>**  SOMA.
    * 
Things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the        ** substance** 
    * 
    SOMA * belongs to Christ.* 
 
 
3) The phrase * body of the flesh*  then refers to the fleshly    ** <u>nature</u>**  within us that was circumcised, disconnected
    and laid aside by means of * the circumcision of Christ*  when Christ
    was cut off from life in His death on the cross.
 
 
    4) From Romans 6:11 we know that as we reckon by faith on this fact we can
    enjoy freedom from the flesh’s tyranny. Because of spiritual circumcision,
    the flesh has lost its ** <u>rights</u>**  to control us.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    f. Colossians 2:11f – * By the circumcision of Christ* … The flesh was
rendered powerless over us when Christ was killed, or cut off, on the    ** <u>cross</u>** . Romans 6:6
 
 
    1) In the NIV the phrase * the circumcision of Christ*  is rendered
the circumcision done by Christ. This translation does not    ** <u>fit</u>**  the passive grammar of the Greek structure.
 
 
    2) The phrase * by the circumcision of Christ*  refers to the death of
    Christ on the ** <u>cross</u>**  as the context confirms. The
    next verse confirms this interpretation, speaking about His burial and
    resurrection and our relationship to it. Daniel 9:26
 
 
    3) The ** <u>glory</u>**  of the cross is that the work of
    Christ not only deals with our sins (plural); it also deals with our sin
    (singular), also referred to as the sin nature, the flesh or the fleshly
    nature. Romans 6:9-10
 
 
a) When we were crucified together with Christ, direct    ** <u>access</u>**  by our sinful flesh to our hearts and lives
    was surgically severed. Galatians 2:20
 
 
    b) The flesh (sin nature) was not immediately destroyed, but its direct
line of access to us was instantly severed, or cut    ** <u>off</u>** .
 
 
c) God has separated from us our sin nature’s right to freely    ** <u>govern</u>**  in our mortal bodies. Romans 6:12
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4) * By the circumcision of Christ* … Now, because of this spiritual
    surgery done to us by God at salvation we do not have to obey the sin
    nature’s desires nor ** <u>yield</u>**  to its authority. This
    victory became ours through our being co-crucified with Christ. Romans
    6:6-7
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    g. Colossians 2:12a – The benefit of your co-death and co-burial with
    Christ is the simple fact that
    ** 
        you don’t have to kill the flesh. You are <u>already</u> dead to it.
    ** 
 
 
    1) Colossians 2:12a – * Having been buried with Him in baptism* … When
    Christ was cut off from ** <u>life</u>**  (circumcision) in His
    death on the cross, we died together with Him and we were also co-entombed
    with Him.
 
 
    a) * Having been buried…*  Here again we see the passive voice in the
    Greek in regard to our baptism ** <u>into</u>**  His death. This
    is something done to the believer by God and not something done by the
    believer.
 
 
    b) Romans 6:3-5 shows our identification with the person of Christ as being
    absolutely ** <u>real</u>**  in the mind of God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c) At the ** <u>moment</u>**  of salvation we were placed into
    Jesus Christ and eternally identified with Him in both his death and
    burial. Romans 6:8; Galatians 2:20; Colossians 2:20, 3:3
 
 
    d) Because of this fact, God counts us as ** <u>dead</u>**  to
    the sin nature and alive unto God in Christ. Our sin nature is not dead,
    but in our co-crucifixion with Christ the fleshly nature’s direct line of
    control and influence was slashed. Romans 6:2, 7
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2) Baptism is of great spiritual significance since it is an    ** <u>act</u>**  of identification.
 
 
    a) In the ancient world with all its initiation rites, it was very
    important to the Spirit of God to ** <u>make</u>**  a
    clarification here.
 
 
    b) The mystery cults like the Gnostics and the ancient Essenes practiced
    baptisms or ceremonial washings as part of becoming an enlightened or
    devoted ** <u>follower</u>** .
 
 
    c) What Colossians 2:12 shows is that in Christ, and with Christ, we have
received a spiritual baptism (identification) that spiritually speaking    ** <u>placed</u>**  us in the tomb together with Christ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d) Christ’s death has become ** <u>our</u>**  death. Often
    well-meaning Christians say things like, “You need to die,” or “You need to
    crucify yourself,” instead of saying, “You should now enjoy your positional
    standing as one who has already died with Christ.” Colossians 2:20
 
 
e) These are two very different concepts: one is based on    ** <u>human</u>**  effort and striving to become dead, and the
    other is based on faith in the fact that God already united us with Christ
    in His cross, tomb and resurrection.
 
 
    f) You should consider the following.
 
 
    (i) When a Christian is baptized in water, he is reenacting as a public
    testimony the spiritual ** <u>fact</u>**  that he was already
    placed into the death, burial and resurrection of Christ at the moment he
    believed.
 
 
(ii) The Holy Spirit baptized you into Christ at the precise    ** <u>instant</u>**  of your faith in Christ alone for
    salvation. Galatians 3:27, 1 Corinthians 12:13
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    h. Colossians 2:12b –
    * 
        In which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working
        of God, who raised Him from the dead
    * 
    . One of the greatest benefits of our co-resurrection with Christ is that
    we now have the ** <u>power</u>**  to live the abundant life.
 
 
1) Colossians 2:12b –    * In which you were also ** <u>raised</u>**  up with Him* …
    We were raised up with Christ so as to live life in a new or distinctive
    way. Romans 6:4b, 11
 
 
    a) * You were also ** <u>raised</u>**  up with Him…*  Here
    we have an aorist passive indicative verb. The aorist tense stresses that
    it already occurred at a specific point in time. The indicative mood gives
    an emphatic sense to the action. And the passive voice means it was
    something done to the believer rather than by the believer.
 
 
    b) * Raised up with Him* … We are now alive from the dead in Christ.
Our former state of being dead in sin and dead to God has    ** <u>changed</u>** . We now possess Christ’s life and as a
    result are alive unto God. Colossians 2:11, John 6:40, Ephesians 2:4-6,
    Colossians 3:1, 2 Corinthians 5:14-17
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) Colossians 2:12c – Our death, burial and resurrection with Christ
    occurred …
    * 
        through ** <u>faith</u>**  in the working of God who raised
        Him from the dead
    * 
    .
 
 
    a) ** <u>God</u>**  was the actor here. The moment you were
    saved, God identified you with Christ in His death, burial and
    resurrection.
 
 
    b) The very ** <u>power</u>**  that raised Jesus Christ from the
    dead is the power that raised us up together with Him so that we are able
    now to serve in the supernatural energy of the Holy Spirit. Ephesians
    1:19-20
 
 
    c) When God included us in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus
Christ in this way, we were given the amazing gift of a    ** <u>new</u>**  way of life that included liberation from
    absolute obedience to the sin nature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    i. Colossians 2:13 – Paul next summarized verses 11-12, emphasizing once
    again these positional ** <u>truths</u>** .
 
 
1) Colossians 2:13a – Let’s look at the two senses in which we were    ** <u>dead</u>** . Remember that biblical death does not mean
    non-existence. It means separation.
 
 
    a) * When you were dead in your transgressions* . We were dead to God
    because of our willful ** <u>sins</u>** .
 
 
    b) * When you were dead in … the uncircumcision of your flesh* . We
were also dead to God because of our direct attachment to the sin    ** <u>nature</u>** .
 
 
    (i) We were dead in the sense that we were detached from God who is the
    source and ** <u>giver</u>**  of life.
 
 
    (ii) In our natural condition of spiritual uncircumcision, we were
    hopelessly captive to the ** <u>flesh</u>** .
 
 
(iii) Thankfully those terrible problems were resolved when we were made    ** <u>alive</u>**  in Christ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) Colossians 2:13b – * He made you alive together with Him* . God be
    praised that we are now ** <u>alive</u>**  with Christ.
 
 
    a) As part of our salvation package, in our identification with Christ God
    the Father made us ** <u>alive</u>**  together with Christ. This
    positional truth describes our new identity in Christ.
 
 
    b) We are now God’s new creation. We have been created, or made alive in,
    the ** <u>person</u>**  of Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:14-21,
    Ephesians 4:23
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3.
    ** 
Colossians 2:13-15 – Christ, not philosophy, gives us freedom from        <u>guilt</u>.
    ** 
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:13c – Christ disposed of our ** <u>sins</u>** 
    and our consuming guilt. * Having forgiven us all our transgressions* 
    .
 
 
    1) * Having ** <u>forgiven</u>**  us* … Paul rejoiced in
    the completed nature of our comprehensive forgiveness. 1 John 2:12
 
 
    a) The unbeliever is never told to ** <u>ask</u>**  for
    forgiveness of sins in order to be saved. Acts 16:31
 
 
    b) On the contrary, the unbeliever is promised forgiveness of sins if he
    will simply ** <u>believe</u>**  on the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts
    10:43, 13:39
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) ** * <u>All</u>* ** *  our transgressions* … Paul
highlighted the comprehensive nature of God’s forgiveness, emphasizing    ** * ALL* ** *  our transgressions* , not merely some
    of them. Micah 7:18-19, Psalm 103:12
 
 
    3) * All ** our**  transgressions* … Paul rejoiced in the
personal nature of God’s forgiveness when he included himself and his** own**  personal sins in the phrase    * all ** <u>our</u>**  transgressions* . Ephesians 4:32
 
 
4) * All our ** transgressions** * … Paul recognized our    ** <u>sins</u>**  for what they really are – transgressions. A
    transgression is a deliberate and willful overstepping of the boundary, a
    blatant disregard for God’s righteous standards. Of course, this statement
    highlights the personal need for forgiveness. Romans 4:7
 
 
    b. Colossians 2:14a –
    * 
        Having ** <u>canceled</u>**  out the certificate of debt…
    * 
    Christ, not philosophy, discarded the certificate of debt that was held
    against us.
 
 
1) The believer’s sin ** <u>debt</u>**  has been    * cancelled out*  EXALEIPHO. The verb * cancelled out*  EXALEIPHO
    means to wipe off, to expunge or to obliterate.
 
 
    2) This was made possible because the perfect Lord Jesus died as our
substitute. The accusations that were against us were placed to    ** <u>His</u>**  account and therefore our debts are gone
    forever.
 
 
    c. Colossians 2:14b –
    * 
        …the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was
        hostile to us
    * 
    … In New Testament days when someone was crucified, a notice was often
    attached above the ** <u>head</u>**  of the criminal delineating
    the crimes that had been committed.
 
 
1) Such signs were designed to show the legitimacy of the    ** <u>death</u>**  penalty.
 
 
    2) In the mind of God, the list of ** <u>crimes</u>**  that were
    against us was nailed to the cross of Christ.
 
 
    3) On the cross, Christ died for the crimes ** <u>we</u>** 
    committed so that the list of sins that denounced us could be blotted out
    forever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Colossians 2:14c –
    * 
        He has ** <u>taken</u>**  it out of the way, having nailed
        it to the cross.
    * 
    Christ’s death, not philosophy, took every decree against us out of the way
    and acquitted us of all charges.
 
 
    1) The Greek verb for * taken out*  AIRO is in the perfect tense. This
    structure indicates that God took all the decrees against you out of the
way at a specific point in time, namely at the point you put your    ** <u>faith</u>**  in Christ, with results extending all the way
    to the present time.
 
 
    2) This verse gives us the clear understanding that our future judgment
    will not be for ** <u>sins</u>** . Our certificate of debt has
    been taken away. Because Christ was already judged for our sins, we will
    not be judged for our sins in the future. John 3:18
 
 
    3) Thank God for the cross of Christ where our ** sin**  debt
    was paid in full. Romans 8:34
 
 
e. Colossians 2:15 – Christ, not philosophy, disarmed    ** <u>Satan</u>**  and his demons.
 
 
1) Colossians 2:15a –    * When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities* . Here we find
another accomplishment of the cross of Christ. Christ triumphed    ** <u>over</u>**  Satan, having defeated him by His cross and
    subsequent resurrection.
 
 
a) We know that in the cross we have forgiveness of    ** <u>sins</u>**  (plural). 1 Corinthians 15:3-4
 
 
    b) We also know that in the cross God ** <u>cut</u>**  free all
    direct control the sin nature had over us through the enactment of a
    spiritual circumcision. Colossians 2:11; Romans 6:10
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c) What we may not know is that in the cross Christ also made Satan's
    absolute ** <u>power</u>**  over us ineffective. John 12:31; 1
    Corinthians 15:23-26; Ephesians 1:20-22, 3:10; Colossians 2:15; 1 Peter
    3:22
 
 
(i) When the text says Christ * disarmed * APEKDUOMAI    * the rulers and authorities* , it literally means He stripped them
    off as when a person quickly ** <u>removes</u>**  clothing.
 
 
(ii) * Disarmed*  ** APEK** DUOMAI has a double prefix APO    ** away from**  and EK ** out from** , which
    powerfully and meaningfully highlights the ** <u>depth</u>**  of
    the Christ’s disarmament of Satan.
 
 
    (iii) The cross work of Christ spelled ** <u>doom</u>**  for all
    the rulers and authorities, especially Satan, since with great gusto and
    passion Christ victoriously hurled them off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) Colossians 2:15b – * He made a public display of them.*  Christ
    made a ** <u>public</u>**  spectacle of Satan and his demons by
    triumphing over them in His cross. Scripture often uses this metaphor for
    triumph. The metaphor depicts the return of a general after an overwhelming
    victory. Ephesians 4:8-11
 
 
    a) The ** <u>Romans</u>**  in particular, whenever they returned
    from war, would parade their enemies by herding them chained in the rear of
    their military precession. 2 Corinthians 2:14-16
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b) From Roman literature we know of ** <u>four</u>**  important
    criteria that had to be met for a conquering general to receive a
    celebrated triumphal entry upon his return to Rome.
 
 
(i) The Roman general had to be the actual victor. He could not    ** <u>claim</u>**  victory for another. He had to personally be
    in command on the battlefield when the wars were actually fought and won.
 
 
(ii) The military campaign could not be a mere    ** <u>partial</u>**  victory. His victory had to be an
    overwhelming success. A triumphant entry was never enacted for victories in
    civil wars or for repelling invaders.
 
 
    (iii) There was also a numeric requirement for a triumphal entry parade.
The army over which a general presided must have killed at least    ** <u>5,000</u>**  enemy combatants during the campaign.
 
 
    (iv) The military campaign had to have ** <u>added</u>** 
    significant new territories to the Roman Empire.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c) Obviously Christ’s ** <u>victory</u>**  was much greater than
    any Roman general’s victory, since His success was against the greatest
    enemy of all time, Satan. Hebrews 9:26
 
 
    d) In Christ we are considered to be ** <u>more</u>**  than
    conquers. This is a positional honor given to every believer at the point
    of salvation. Romans 8:37, 1 John 5:4-5
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Colossians 2:15c – How did God make a public display of His enemies? He
did this, * having triumphed over them through *     ** <u>Christ</u>** .
 
 
    a) What might have seemed to be the ** <u>demise</u>**  of God’s
    plans, and even God’s King, actually became the greatest victory heaven and
    earth has ever known. 1 Corinthians 2:8
 
 
    b) By means of the cross, God conquered ** <u>Satan</u>**  and
    all demonic foes. Everything that stood in the way of our salvation was
    soundly defeated.
 
 
c) The just died for the unjust, therefore    * the accuser of the brethren*  has ** <u>no</u>**  case
    against us. 1 Peter 3:18, Revelation 12:10
    <br/>
    <br/>

## C. Colossians 2:16 – Legalism, the second heresy

===
 
### 1. What is **<u>legalism</u>**?

===
 
a. Legalism among the **<u>unsaved</u>**. Galatians 2:16; Acts 15:1, 8-11
 
===

1) This is the mental attitude of the false believer who seeks to  **<u>earn</u>**  or merit salvation by religious rituals, human efforts or good works. Most cults, and virtually all religions, practice a form of legalism. Galatians 2:4

===

2) When anyone **<u>adds</u>**  good works as a prerequisite or requirement for salvation to what Christ has already accomplished, they are guilty of legalism. Philippians 3:2-3

===

3) Legalistic unbelievers think, “Since I have done (fill in the blank) God now **<u>owes</u>** me salvation.”

===
 
b. Legalism among the **<u> saved </u>**. Acts 15:5, 11-13; Galatians 2:4-5, 16, 3:3-5, 4:21-31 

===

1) This refers to the believer who seeks to earn or merit God’s acceptance or **<u>blessing</u>** by religious rituals, human efforts, or through the fulfillment of requirements.
 
===

2) Legalists feel that progressive sanctification is based on their works and human **<u>efforts</u>** rather than on the grace of God through a walk of faith in Christ.

===
 
3) Legalistic Christians say, “Since I have done (fill in the blank), God now **<u>owes</u>** me blessings.”
   
===
 
c. Consider the following in relation to legalism. Galatians 5:4, Philippians 3:1-9

===
 
1) Whether it is for salvation or for sanctification, a legalist becomes captivated with human determination and doing good works to **<u>merit</u>** God’s help or blessing. Matthew 7:22-23

===
 
2) Legalistic Christians are **<u>proud</u>**. They have not understood that they cannot please God by human effort. Romans 7:18

===
 
3) A legalist is captivated with himself rather than with **<u>Christ</u>**. His eyes are always on himself and his performance rather than on Christ and His adequacy. Legalists compare themselves with others. Galatians 5:15, 25-26
   
===
 
4) Legalistic Christians do not rest **<u>solely</u>** on Christ’s enabling power for living the Christian life; they feel they need to do their part. 2 Corinthians 3:4-6, 5:7; Galatians 3:3, 2:20
 
===

5) Some people contend that if they do **<u>not</u>** live by laws, principles, or rules they will end up sinning.

===
 
a) The irony of this is that those who live by law with its rules and regulations, actually **<u>arouse</u>** the sin nature to break the very rules they have set up for holy living. Romans 6:14; 7:5; 8-9, 11; 1 Corinthians 15:56

===
 
b) Legalism actually moves the believer **<u>away</u>** from spiritual growth rather than closer to it. Galatians 5:4

===
 
6) In your present standing in Christ you have **<u>all</u>** of Christ’s abundance at your disposal. You are to walk by faith in Him. Colossians 2:3, 6, 10; John 15:4-5
   
===

2. Colossians 2:16 – Paul initiated his corrections aimed at the heresy of legalism by first teaching the Colossians to not **<u>allow</u>** anyone *…to act as [their] judge.* 
 
===

a. Colossians 2:16a – Paul commanded them to not fall prey to legalists with their judgmental **<u>spirit</u>**.

===
 
1) This command to *not let others … act, as your judge*  KRINETO is a present tense imperative. The present tense indicates that this type of judging was happening at the **<u>moment</u>** Paul wrote. The believers were told to stop letting others interfere or referee in their lives. Romans 14:3

===
 
2) Legalists always possess a judgmental spirit. Their austere and ungracious demeanor will not only **<u>crush</u>** your spirit but will lead you to error. If you fall into their ways, you will lose a faith-based intimate walk with the Lord and replace it with an unfruitful burdensome life of dos and don’ts. Galatians 5:15, 25-26

===
 
b. Colossians 2:16b –*Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food* … A legalist gets judgmental and demanding about your **<u>private</u>** life. Eating *food* is one of the most basic functions of life and the legalist wants to control it. Romans 14:1-4, Mark 7:5-23, 1 Timothy 4:3-4

===
 
1) Legalists lead you to believe that what you eat is of **<u>extreme</u>** **spiritual** significance. Legalists will tell you what you must or must not eat. They will control your diet, which biblically is none of their business. Romans 14:23

===
 
2) Paul predicted that in the last days the world would be fraught with **<u>food</u>** restrictions. 1 Timothy 4:3-4

===
 
3) Do you have people trying to control your diet by telling you their way of eating is more spiritual or that it is the **<u>right</u>** way? Matthew 15:11, 15-20; Luke 7:34
    
===
 
c. Colossians 2:16c –* Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to …drink*. While the Bible condemns drunkenness, the legalist wants to make what you drink a **<u> spiritual </u>** issue. Ephesians 5:18

===
 
1) Romans 14:17 shows that the future kingdom of God is **<u>not</u>** about eating and drinking, implying that we should modulate our rhetoric accordingly.

===

2) Jesus said that it is not what you take into your body that defiles you but rather what comes **<u>out</u>** of your heart. Matthew 15:17-20

===
 
3) 1 Corinthians 10:31 says that in all you eat or drink, do all to the **<u>glory</u>** of God.

===

d. Colossians 2:16d – *Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard…to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day*. Legalists not only get judgmental and demanding about what you eat, they also make demands on how you **<u>worship</u>**. Romans 14:5-6, 10

===
 
1) *Festivals* were the **<u>holy</u>** days and feast days that Moses set forth in the Law. Galatians 4:9-11
 
===

a) This is not referring to **<u>holidays</u>** or national observances celebrated in your country.

===

b) This is referring to days observed by the religious establishment. It is referring to days that all so-called Christians have “**<u>always</u>**” observed.
 
===

c) Legalists believe that by observing these **<u>days</u>** they are being good people. They think that they please God by observing certain days and may judge you for not doing so, or for observing other days. Legalists always obligate you to do the same things they do.
    
===
 
2) Paul also mentioned *New **<u>Moon</u>*** celebrations that legalists wanted to require. Isaiah 1:10-15
 
===

a) The New Moon was an elaborate religious **<u>day</u>** in Israel. Special sacrifices were made at that time.

===
 
b) Historically a New Moon day would set the month’s calendar of religious activities in **<u>Israel</u>**.

===
 
c) On a New Moon celebration all work would be suspended and no private or public **<u>feasts</u>** or festivals were allowed.

===
 
d) Religious legalists delight in **<u>imposing</u>** these types of religious observances on your life.

===
 
3) Paul included a mention of ***<u>Sabbath</u>*** *days*. Legalists love to obligate Christians to observe their particular idea of a Sabbath day custom. Exodus 20:8-11

===

a) According to the Mosaic **<u>Law</u>**, the Sabbath was a day to be faithfully remembered by national Israel.

===
 
b) Failure to faithfully observe the Sabbath was supposed to result in the **<u>death</u>** penalty. Exodus 31:14-15

===
 
c) This law was never instituted for the **<u>church</u>**, although even today legalists seek to enslave uninformed believers in a form of Sabbath observance.

===
 
e. In summary, we should note that all five elements of legalism mentioned in verse 16 had their **<u>source</u>** in Judaism. Obviously legalistic Judaism was one of the heretical teachings disrupting the church of Colossae.

===
 
## D. Colossians 2:17 – How to safeguard yourself against the heresy of  legalism

===
 
1. Colossians 2:17 – In order to not fall victim to legalism you need to understand the **<u>main</u>** problem with legalism.

===
 
a. Colossians 2:17a – *Things which are a mere shadow of what is to come.*  Legalism is captivated with **<u>hollow</u>** or empty substitutes for real fellowship with the Lord.

===
 
1) Legalism is like an infatuation with the **<u>shadow</u>** or reflection of an object rather than with the object itself.

===

2) If you get caught up in observing the things detailed in verse 16, you will be focused on the shadows of Christ previewed in ancient Judaism and not on the actual **<u>person</u>** of Christ as revealed in the New Testament.

===
 
3) This could be compared to a photograph of a loved one who is far from home. Although the photograph **<u>reminds</u>** you of your loved one, it is not your loved one. Imagine hugging the photograph after your loved one’s return. That would be foolish.

=== 
 
4) Legalism is that kind of cheap substitute for a **<u>real</u>** and intimate relationship with Christ. Legalists become fixed on principles, rules and traditions they find in Scripture rather than on Christ Himself. Galatians 3:24-25
  
=== 
 
b. Colossians 2:17b –*But the substance *SOMA * belongs to Christ…* Freedom, versus the slavery of legalism, is found in Christ. Christ is the **<u>real</u>** substance; legalism on the other hand is external and only dimly reflective of Christ.
 
===

1) Are you having fellowship with the person of Christ or are you simply going through the motions of religion? Are you doing church or are you enjoying fellowship with Christ?
 
=== 

2) To safeguard from legalism, do not allow anyone to become your **<u>judge</u>** and put you on a guilt trip by getting into the minutia of your personal or spiritual life.
  
===
## E. Colossians 2:18-19a – Mysticism, the third heresy
 
 
    1. Colossians 2:18 – Let’s discern the dangers of mysticism.
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:18a – * Let no ** one** …*  Paul again
    started this section by ** <u>warning</u>**  believers against
    external control and manipulation. The heresy of mysticism typically has a
    charismatic and controlling leader who ** claims**  to have
    supernatural power, extraordinary faith, or the sign gifts.
 
 
b. Colossians 2:18b – ** * Let * ** * no one ** keep defrauding you** * … The phrase* let no one keep [on] defrauding you*  is a    ** <u>present</u>**  tense imperative in Greek. The use of this
    verb tense indicates that this was a very present danger in Colossae. You
    too could succumb to this error, so you also should heed this command.
 
 
c. Colossians 2:18c –    * Let no one keep defrauding you ** of your prize** * …
    Paul commanded the Colossian believers to not tolerate interventions by
anyone who might act as judge or referee and somehow    ** <u>cheat</u>**  them from true victory.
 
 
1) * Defraud*  is the word KATABRABEUO composed of KATA** against**  and BRABEUO ** line-<u>judge</u>**  or    ** referee** . The use of this word implies that a referee might
    make an unfair call resulting in your loss.
 
 
    2) Although the phrase * of your prize*  is not found explicitly in
    the ** <u>Greek</u>**  text, the idea of disqualification is
    implied in the word * defraud* .
 
 
    3) With its focus on experiences, the heresy of mysticism stealthily
presents itself under a guise of spirituality while in reality    ** <u>robbing</u>**  you of all spiritual progress.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
d. Colossians 2:18e – * Let no one keep defrauding you * …    * by delighting in…*  Mysticism will put an arbitrator between you and
Jesus Christ. Defrauded of Jesus, you’ll delight yourself in the    ** <u>wrong</u>**  things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 2:18f-19a – Let’s look at ** <u>six</u>**  aspects
    of the heresy of mysticism in which a believer might misguidedly take
    delight.
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:18f – ** Aspect 1** : Typically the heresy of
    mysticism comes with a guru or spiritual leader who will ultimately
    * 
defraud you of your ** <u>prize</u>**  by delighting in        ** self-abasement** 
    * 
    – your self-abasement not his.
 
 
    1) The heresy of mysticism often hosts a supposed spiritual leader who
    mesmerizes and ** <u>controls</u>**  unguarded believers.
 
 
    2) Leaders in the heresy of mysticism tend to glory in their great humility
    and alleged ** <u>inside</u>**  track with God. They go to great
    lengths to explain their spiritual exploits and experiences.
 
 
    3) In this error the leader typically grabs the spotlight from Christ and
the ** <u>flock</u>**  unwittingly follows him, being drug    ** away from the Lord** . Acts 20:30
 
 
    4) Because of their delight with * self-abasement*  they will usually
    require extreme submission from their followers. In their quest for
    supernatural power or miraculous experiences they often subject their
    followers to ** <u>engage</u>**  in debasing or humiliating
    actions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5) If you have a tendency toward mysticism you will likely believe that
    humility, or self-abasement, is the ** <u>secret</u>**  to
    spirituality. Sadly, over time this heresy disconnects believers from
    Christ as the source of strength for their life.
 
 
    6) Under mysticism you become ** <u>guilty</u>**  of replacing
    reality in your fellowship with Christ with a fixation on experiences like
    supposedly seeing angels, having visions, or other supernatural
    achievements.
 
 
    7) As an outcome, you will see yourself negatively. You will consider
yourself unworthy, being forced into the humility of** * self-abasement* ** . You might    ** <u>feel</u>**  obligated to fast, spend long hours in prayer,
    practice overnight vigils, kneel, or let yourself be hit in the face or
    pushed down. 2 Corinthians 11:20
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    8) Contrary to being forced into humiliation consider the following:
 
 
a) In the church, pastors and elders are called to tenderly shepherd the    ** <u>flock</u>**  of God. In shepherding, there must not to be
    heavy-handed control or forced submission. 1 Peter 5:2-4, 3 John 9-10
 
 
    b) Since ** * self-abasement* **  is presented here in a
negative light, it is obviously not speaking of    ** <u>true</u>**  humility. True humility is seen in James 4:6
    where
    * 
        God resists the proud but gives grace to the ** humble** 
    * 
and in 1 Peter 5:6 where God says, “** * Humble yourselves* **     *  under the mighty hand of God* .”
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 2:18g – ** Aspect 2** : Don’t let anyone defraud
    you by * …the worship of angels* . The heresy of mysticism misdirects
    believers into an unhealthy obsession with ** <u>angels</u>** ,
    whether good or bad (demons). 1 Timothy 4:1-2
 
 
    1) According to the ** <u>false</u>**  teaching already taught
    in Paul’s day, and even more so later under Gnosticism, celestial beings
    were said to be part of the fullness needed to reach God.
 
 
2) This heresy opens one up to thinking he needs    ** <u>angels</u>**  or other supernatural intermediaries to
    approach God or navigate through life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Colossians 2:18h – ** Aspect 3** : Don’t let anyone defraud
    you by * …taking his stand on visions he has seen* … The heresy of
    mysticism teaches that supernatural or ecstatic experiences such as visions
    are the ** <u>basis</u>** , or measure, of true spirituality.
 
 
    1) Under this error, undue emphasis gets placed on experiences. Experiences
can become more important to you than the truth of God’s    ** <u>Word</u>** .
 
 
    2) Leaders who are mystical will go on and on about spiritual experiences
    they have had in order to demonstrate their ** <u>claim</u>** 
    to superior spiritual power and authority.
 
 
    3) The phrase * taking ** his**  stand*  EMBATEOU came to
    be a special ** <u>term</u>**  used by mystery cults to describe
    the initiation process required to enter the inner circle of their false
    religion. It is interesting that the Holy Spirit had Paul use a word common
    to mysticism to expose their error.
 
 
d. Colossians 2:18i – ** Aspect 4** : Don’t let anyone who is …    * inflated ** <u>without</u>**  cause…*  defraud you. The
    heresy of mysticism inspires spiritual arrogance.
 
 
1) * Inflated without cause*  is being full of hot    ** <u>air</u>** . It is spiritual pride.
 
 
    2) Mysticism claims ** <u>humility</u>**  while actually being
    nothing more than repulsive pride.
 
 
    e. Colossians 2:18j – ** Aspect 5** : Don’t let anyone defraud
you since that individual would simply be …* inflated*     * without cause ** by his fleshly mind** * . The heresy of
    mysticism is characterized by the ** <u>fleshly</u>**  mind
    being in control of the individual.
 
 
    1) The phrase * by his fleshly mind*  shows that the heresy of
    mysticism is nothing more than a work of the ** <u>flesh</u>** .
 
 
2) Mysticism creates a disconnection with Christ and allows the* fleshly mind*  rather than the Lord to    ** <u>control</u>**  the individual or the church.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    f. Colossians 2:19a – ** Aspect 6** : Don’t let anyone defraud
    you by * …not holding fast to the head* … The ultimate peril of the
error of mysticism is that it generates a detachment from the    ** <u>headship</u>**  of Jesus Christ.
 
 
1) In its essence, this heresy creates a distance between    ** <u>Christ</u>**  and His church or Christ and the individual.
    Christ is there, but He is not directing. Christ becomes superseded by the
    pseudo-spirituality of a charismatic leader.
 
 
2) * And not holding fast * KRATEO… is a    ** <u>present</u>**  tense participle stressing the immediate
necessity to hold tightly to Christ. In Acts 24:6 the same word for    * hold fast*  KRATEO is used of the Jews who tightly seized Paul in
    the temple, firmly gripping him without relaxing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Here Paul used the term * holding fast*  KRATEO figuratively to
    communicate intensity and describe the ** <u>peril</u>**  the
    church could experience if it did not hold its head, Jesus Christ, with a
    tight grip.
 
 
    4) The truth is that if we do not consistently hold tightly to the head of
    the church, Jesus Christ, we will ultimately ** <u>lose</u>** 
    that necessary and vital link with Him and fall victim to mysticism.
    Galatians 5:4b
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** F. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 2:19b – How to safeguard against the heresy of mysticism
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 2:19b – We are to consistently * hold fast*  to our one
    true ** <u>head</u>** , Jesus Christ, and reject the heresy of
    mysticism.
 
 
2. Colossians 2:19c –    * From whom the ** <u>entire</u>**  body…* 
 
 
    a. Christ is the one and ** <u>only</u>**  head of the body.
    Ephesians 5:23
 
 
    b. Obviously we might live just fine without a hand or foot, but we cannot
    live without a head. Our head houses our brain, which controls all the
functions of the body. Even the air, food and water that    ** <u>sustain</u>**  our health enter our body through the head
    by way of the mouth. We need our head!
 
 
    c. In like ** <u>manner</u>** , we cannot live spiritually
    without our head, Jesus Christ, who constantly supplies us with all we need
    for life and godliness. We need Christ, not some alleged super-spiritual
    expert.
 
 
3. Colossians 2:19d –    * …being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments...* 
 
 
    a. As individual members of Christ’s body, we are to walk in unity and love
    so that we ** <u>build</u>**  each other up. Ephesians 4:16
 
 
    b. Christ is the only head; all the ** <u>rest</u>**  of us are
    members of His body. Instead of each part paying homage to or serving some
    so-called gifted leader the individual parts all contribute to the
    well-being of the whole for the glory of the head, Jesus Christ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
4. Colossians 2:19e – The entire body …* grows with a growth, which is from God* . True spiritual    ** <u>growth</u>**  comes from God alone and not from some
    mysterious phenomena or mystical experience. We do not look to those things
    or to individuals who make great claims in that way.
 
 
    a. ** <u>God</u>** , not some person, is the only true agent of
    growth. Colossians 2:7
 
 
b. Although God uses His Word, Bible teachers, and fellow believers,    ** <u>God</u>**  is the ultimate cause of all true spiritual
    growth. 1 Corinthians 3:6-7, Ephesians 4:11-16
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** G. ** 
    ** Colossians 2:20-23 ** 
    – ** Asceticism, the fourth heresy** 
 
 
    1. What is asceticism?
 
 
a. Asceticism is erroneous teaching that suggests that self-    ** <u>denial</u>** , self-discipline and self-restraint are keys
    to sanctification. This error suggests that in order to be holy you simply
    need to dominate the body.
 
 
    b. This error concludes that the human ** <u>body</u>**  is the
    root problem standing in the way of our godliness. Therefore self-inflicted
    pain, harsh controls and deprivations to the body are needed to achieve
    holiness.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 2:20 – Paul sharply dismissed the usefulness of asceticism in
    making us ** <u>holy</u>**  by turning the reader to
    identification truth. Let’s look at ** four**  quick arguments
    against asceticism found in this one verse. All Paul’s answers stem from
    the positional truth of being dead with Christ to the world. Galatians 6:14
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:20a – * If you have died* … ** First** 
    Paul made it clear that asceticism does not work for holiness because we
    are ** <u>dead</u>**  people. Are you aware that you are dead
    with Christ and what that means practically?
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    1) This if statement is a ** <u>first</u>**  class condition in
    the Greek language. In this context we could understand it as “if you have
    died, and for the sake of argument let’s assume that you did indeed die.”
 
 
2) At salvation God identified us with the death of Christ on the    ** <u>cross</u>** . Galatians 2:20, Romans 6:5-6, Colossians 3:3
 
 
    3) What are some of the things we know to be true of us now because of our
    identity in Christ?
 
 
    a) We know we died with Christ to the ** <u>world</u>** .
    Galatians 6:14
 
 
b) We know we died with Christ to domination by the sin    ** <u>nature</u>** . Romans 6:2, 6, 7, 10; Galatians 5:24
 
 
    c) We know we died with Christ to the ** <u>power</u>**  and
    control of the devil. Hebrews 2:14-15, Colossians 2:15
 
 
    d) We know we died with Christ to the ** <u>law</u>**  and its
    jurisdiction. Romans 7:4-6, Galatians 2:19, 1 Corinthians 9:20
 
 
e) We also know we died with Christ to the burden of ongoing    ** <u>guilt</u>**  since our sins, never to be recalled again,
    were nailed to the cross with Him. Colossians 2:13-14
 
 
    4) Why did Paul use our position of being dead with Christ to explain why
    asceticism is not for the believer?
 
 
a) Paul stated that practicing asceticism is of no value because    ** <u>pain</u>**  has no effect on the dead. Asceticism with its
    self-inflicted harshness is of no value in making one who has died with
    Christ holy.
 
 
    b) It would be foolish to ** <u>yell</u>**  at a dead person
    saying, “Do not handle. Do not taste. Do not touch.” So it is with those in
    Christ who are dead to sin.
 
 
    5) It is important for us to understand the vast difference between the
    self-effort of crucifying yourself and recognizing by faith your position
    of ** <u>already</u>**  having been crucified by God at
    salvation. Romans 6:6, Galatians 2:20
 
 
    a) Matthew 16:24-26 – When Jesus said to deny yourself, take up your cross
    and follow Him, He was not saying to ** <u>beat</u>**  the body
    into subjection to produce righteous living. He was speaking of not
    preserving our lives as Peter had just suggested (vv.21-23).
 
 
b) 1 Corinthians 9:26-27 – When Paul stated that he disciplined his    ** <u>body</u>** , it was not a slip-up where he suddenly fell
    into asceticism. He was talking about not pampering the flesh but rather by
    faith through the Spirit putting to death the deeds of the body. Romans
    8:13, Colossians 3:5
 
 
    c) Galatians 5:22-23 – Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit produced in
    the believer who is walking by ** <u>faith</u>**  and not equal
    in any way to the self-domination of Christians who promote asceticism.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 2:20b –
    * 
If you died with Christ        ** to the elementary principles of the <u>world</u>** 
    * 
    … A ** second ** reason not to practice asceticism is because it
    is based on the world’s simplistic, or elementary, way of achieving
    morality.
 
 
    1) * The elementary principles*  STOICHEIA * of the world* 
    refers to the rudimentary, primary, or ** <u>basic</u>** 
    prescriptions the world imposes on society in order to enforce conformity.
    It is the world's method of controlling fleshly desires and indulgences.
 
 
2) Typically going ** <u>back</u>**  to the    * elementary principles of the world*  becomes the method that
    out-of-control worldly Christians enthusiastically employ.
 
 
    3) On the contrary, we need to ** <u>daily</u>**  be reminded of
    our position in Christ as dead to sin and alive unto God. This will keep us
    from the frustration and ineffectiveness of asceticism in generating a true
    change of conduct. Romans 6:17-18
 
 
c. Colossians 2:20c – Why, * as if living in the world* … A** third ** reason we reject asceticism is because we understand    ** <u>our</u>**  heavenly position in Christ and the fact that
    we are not part of this cosmic system. This helps avoid worldly, simplistic
    methods for controlling people. Ephesians 2:6, Colossians 3:1-3
 
 
    d. Colossians 2:20d – Why …* do you submit yourself to decrees* ? In
    the ** fourth ** place, asceticism relies on * decrees* 
    DOGMATIZO or negative declarations. We do not practice asceticism because
in reality it is basically a debasing form of    ** <u>slavery</u>** . Asceticism relies on depriving or
    afflicting yourself in order to be spiritual.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
3. Colossians 2:21-23 – Paul explained some very negative    ** <u>elements</u>**  of asceticism.
 
 
    a. Colossians 2:21 – Sadly the error of asceticism is based on prohibitions
    and ** <u>demands</u>**  put on one’s self. Paul therefore asks,
    “
    * 
        Why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to
        decrees, such as…?
    * 
    ”
 
 
    1) Don’t ** <u>grab</u>**  this! * Do not handle…* 
 
 
2) Don’t ** <u>put</u>**  that in your mouth!    * Do not taste* …
 
 
3) And don’t even think of laying a ** <u>finger</u>**  on it!    * Do not touch* …
 
 
b. Colossians 2:22a –    * Which all refer to things destined to perish with use…*  Next Paul
appropriately pointed out that asceticism quickly    ** <u>loses</u>**  its effectiveness.
 
 
    1) If you try to better or control yourself by self-deprivation your
    efforts will unravel in time. You’ll end up tossing out your efforts like
    an ** <u>old</u>**  ragged garment.
 
 
2) In other words, this approach to spirituality will not    ** <u>last</u>**  long and will ** never**  bring you
    the holiness you desire.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 2:22b – Asceticism is …    * in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men.* 
Asceticism incorrectly follows earthly or human    ** <u>logic</u>** .
 
 
    d. Colossians 2:23a –
    * 
        These are matters, which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom
    * 
    … Asceticism is ** very**  deceptive since on the outside it
    seems to be based on godly ** <u>wisdom</u>** . James 3:13-18
 
 
    1) The deception of asceticism is that it gives an immediate fix to
    out-of-control living. Many Christians gravitate to any unbiblical answer
    if it seems to quickly solve their ** <u>problem</u>** .
    Proverbs 14:12, 16:25
 
 
2) Our flesh opts for worldly solutions to provide temporary    ** <u>fixes</u>** . This keeps us from having to deal with the
    root problem, the sin nature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
e. Colossians 2:23b – Asceticism is wrapped up …* in self-made religion* … meaning contrived or homespun    ** <u>piety</u>** . The pious nature of asceticism makes it
    attractive to sincere believers. Galatians 3:2-3
 
 
    f. Colossians 2:23c – * In* …* self-abasement* … Asceticism
    requires that the individual be abased or ** <u>forced</u>** 
    into subjection. * Self-abasement*  TAPEINOPHROSUNE holds the idea of
    obligating yourself to experience a profound sense of insignificance. It is
    basically a form of beating up on yourself.
 
 
g. Colossians 2:23d – Ultimately the heresy of asceticism requires …    ** * <u>severe</u>* ** *  treatment of the body* .
 
 
1) Asceticism can go so far as to encourage cruel    ** <u>torture</u>**  of the human body in order to gain
    spirituality.
 
 
    2) Supposing to gain points with God, there have been cases where people
    have ** <u>starved</u>**  themselves, beat themselves, or even
    submitted to crucifixion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4. Colossians 2:23 – Asceticism’s folly:
    * 
        But are of no value ** <u>against</u>**  fleshly indulgence
    * 
    . In this one phrase Paul discarded asceticism as woefully inadequate for
    creating change. Why?
 
 
a. Initially in verse 20 we observed that asceticism is no more than the* elementary principles of the world*  and therefore    ** <u>empty</u>**  and deceptive. Colossians 2:8
 
 
b. Here we see that these futile efforts …* are of no value against fleshly indulgence* . They do not harness    ** <u>evil</u>**  desires or prevent selfish and immoral
    behavior.
 
 
    1) Asceticism does not deal with the ** <u>root</u>**  problem
    of the flesh, the cause of sin in our lives. Instead of encouraging a walk
    of faith focused on Christ, asceticism foolishly leads to the futility of
    trying to control the sin nature. Romans 7:8-11, Galatians 5:16-17
 
 
    2) This method always results in abject ** <u>failure</u>** .
 
 
    3) Asceticism just cannot ** <u>stop</u>**  you from sinning or
    make you holy. The NET Bible puts it aptly, saying that instead of holy
    living * they in reality result in fleshly indulgence* . Asceticism’s
    disaster is that it actually increases fleshly indulgence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. As with the other three heresies, asceticism is a major    ** <u>affront</u>**  to Jesus Christ’s adequacy to change
    believers.
 
 
    1) The heresy of asceticism ** <u>demeans</u>**  Christ’s
    ability to make you holy.
 
 
    2) Asceticism rejects the important significance of our death with Christ
to the sin nature, putting emphasis on self's    ** <u>ability</u>**  to control the flesh rather than on our
    identification with the finished work of Christ on the cross. Romans
    6:10-11
 
 
    3) ** <u>Many</u>**  of today’s so-called spiritual disciplines
    are tantamount to asceticism.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Child of God, you have a choice. For holiness, you can go with
    asceticism and rely on your own efforts to change or you can learn to walk
    by ** <u>faith</u>**  relying on Christ's provisions for your
    sanctification. Colossians 2:6
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>

# VII. Colossians 3:1-11 – Changed Focus: Keeping a Focus on Heaven
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:1-2 – Paul encouraged the Colossians to develop a heavenly
        mindset based on their identity in Christ.
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 3:1a –
    * 
        If then you have been ** <u>raised</u>**  up with Christ
    * 
… Our position in Christ is foundational to correct Christian living.     
 
 
    a.
    * 
        If then you have been ** <u>raised</u>**  up with Christ…
    * 
    The word*  if*  is a first class condition that could be understood
as, “If you have been raised up with Christ,** and let’s assume it is true** … therefore...”     
 
 
    1) This is a continuation of Paul’s comment from Colossians 2:20. We saw
the same conditional structure indicating that we did indeed    ** <u>die</u>**  with Christ; therefore we are not to submit to
    the world system. 
 
 
    2) Here, instead of reminding the Colossian believers of their death with
    Christ, Paul went a step further and reminded them of their resurrection
    together with Christ. * Raised up*  denotes being both co-resurrected
and co-ascended ** <u>with</u>**  Christ. Ephesians 2:6     
 
 
    3) This identification ** <u>with</u>**  Christ was something
    done ** to**  the believer and not ** by**  the
    believer. 
 
 
4) Our co-resurrection with Christ is an accomplished    ** <u>fact</u>**  in the mind of God. It occurred at the moment
    we put our faith in Christ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
     
 
 
    b. Founded on the believer’s spiritual position of being raised up with
Christ, the apostle gave the Colossian believers** <u>two</u>**  important commands about desires and focus (    * keep seeking*  and * set your mind* ). 
 
 
    c. ** Only**  based out of our position of co-raised with Christ
    will we be able to properly ** <u>obey</u>**  these commands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
     
 
 
2. Colossians 3:1b – ** * Keep seeking* ** *  the things above… * Paul’s first command to** * keep seeking* **  is related to our    ** <u>desires</u>** .
 
 
    a. The word * seek*  ZETEO is a verb of intensity and passion that
    implies a diligent ** <u>search</u>** . This verb was used to
    describe people determined to get to the bottom of a matter. Matthew 2:13,
    6:33; Acts 21:31; 1 Peter 5:8
 
 
    b. Being a present active imperative shows that Paul was demanding an
    immediate and proactive search into * the things above* .
 
 
    c. In order to advance our ** <u>desire</u>**  to seek heavenly
    things, Paul added two important realities about our resurrected Savior.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3. Colossians 3:1c – We are commanded to seek the things that have to do
with Christ’s ** finished work** .** * Keep seeking* **     *  the things above ** where Christ is <u>seated</u>** * …
 
 
    a. We have a risen and ** <u>living</u>**  Savior who is
    adequate for all our needs. Christ is seated in heaven because His work is
    finished. Hebrews 1:3, 8:1-2
 
 
b. Not only do we have a qualified Savior, but also we have been    ** <u>fully</u>**  identified with Him. We greatly benefit from
    this identification with Him. Romans 6:8-11
 
 
1) If we died with Christ and we did, then we are indeed dead to    ** <u>sin</u>**  just as He is. Sin’s outright power and grip on
    our lives has been broken. Romans 6:2
 
 
    2) If we rose again with Christ and we did, then just as He is alive unto
    God we too are alive indeed unto ** <u>God</u>** ; therefore, we
    are no longer obligated to follow this satanic worldly system. Galatians
    6:14
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4. Colossians 3:1d – We are further commanded to seek the things that have
to do with Christ’s ** supreme authority** .    ** * Keep seeking* ** 
    * 
the things above where Christ is seated        ** at the <u>right</u> hand of God** 
    * 
    .
 
 
    a. Seated at the right hand of God the Father, Jesus Christ has been given
    the most ** <u>exalted</u>**  position in the entire universe.
    Hebrews 4:16
 
 
b. He and no one else possesses this position of highest    ** <u>honor</u>**  in heaven, and your sanctification is based
    on identification with Him there. Romans 6:11, 2 Timothy 1:1
 
 
    c. Since Christ is risen, seated and honored in this way, we can rest
    assured He is adequate for all our ** <u>needs</u>** , wants,
    problems and questions. We ought therefore to * keep seeking*  Him. No
    one else is worthy or able to help us.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
5. Colossians 3:2a – Paul’s second command to    ** * set your <u>mind</u>* ** *  on things above* 
    relates to our focus.
 
 
    a. Set PHRONEO is another penetrating verb conveying the idea of
    pinpointing your focus or being very ** <u>intent</u>**  on
    something. In Philippians 2:5 it is translated * have this attitude* 
    or * let this mind be in you* .
 
 
b. Paul appealed to our understanding of identification    ** <u>truths</u>**  by commanding us to focus on heavenly things
    based on the fact that we have indeed been raised up with Christ as part of
    our position in Him. Proverbs 23:7a
 
 
    c. The * things ** <u>above</u>** *  should become the
    focus of our thinking. How much of our thinking is actually absorbed with
    heavenly matters? Philippians 4:8
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
6. Colossians 3:2b –    * Set your mind ** on things above** * … Paul wanted them
    to ** <u>focus</u>**  in on their heavenly position and
    possessions.
 
 
    a. Did you know that your citizenship is in ** <u>heaven</u>** ?
    Philippians 3:20
 
 
    b. Did you know you have a ** <u>hope</u>**  laid up for you in
    heaven? Colossians 1:5
 
 
    c. Did you know you have a ** <u>master</u>**  in heaven who
    watches you? Colossians 4:1
 
 
d. Did you know you have an inheritance reserved for    ** <u>you</u>**  in heaven? 1 Peter 1:4
 
 
    e. Did you know you have been blessed with ** <u>every</u>** 
    spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms? Ephesians 1:3
 
 
f. Did you know you are guaranteed participation in the heavenly    ** <u>kingdom</u>** ? Colossians 1:12, 2 Timothy 4:18, 1 Peter
    1:3-5
 
 
g. Did you know you have been made the partaker of a heavenly    ** <u>calling</u>** ? Hebrews 3:1
 
 
    h. Did you know you are ** <u>seated</u>**  in Christ in heaven
    right now? Ephesians 2:6
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
7. Colossians 3:2c – Don’t * set your mind*  …    * on the things that are on ** <u>earth</u>** * .
 
 
    a. Reject ** <u>cheap</u>**  earthly substitutes like the
    heresies Paul described in chapter two. All those deviations will detract
    you from spiritual progress.
 
 
1) We should recognize the bankruptcy of philosophy, counting it as    ** <u>simple</u>** , elementary thinking and empty deception.
 
 
    2) Being merely a ** <u>faint</u>**  shadow of the truth, we
    ought to reject legalism.
 
 
3) We should cast off mysticism as a distraction that removes us from our    ** <u>head</u>** , Jesus Christ.
 
 
    4) We should ** <u>avoid</u>**  all forms of asceticism as
    homespun religion, totally incapable of changing our fleshly passions and
    desires.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. The story of Mary and Martha is a timeless example of setting our minds
    on heavenly things and ** <u>not</u>**  on the things of the
    earth. Luke 10:38-42, John 12:2-3
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** Colossians 3:3-4 – Why should we have a heavenly mindset?** 
 
 
1. Colossians 3:3a – Why should we * seek*  for and* set our minds*  on heavenly things? Paul’s first reason was, “    * For you ** <u>have</u>**  died* .”
 
 
    a. Paul wanted the Colossians to align their thinking with God’s thinking
    on this matter of having ** <u>died</u>**  with Christ. 2
    Corinthians 5:14; Galatians 5:24, 6:14
 
 
    b. Notice how Paul continually ** <u>drew</u>**  his readers
    back to positional, or identification, truth, particularly related to the
    death and resurrection of Christ. This was obviously of major importance to
    Paul, and therefore should be to us as well. Galatians 2:20
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. The mention of our death with Christ was intentional since this    ** <u>truth</u>**  is the footing on which Paul built the
    doctrine of sanctification. Romans 6:1-11
 
 
    d. Because you * have died* , or were * crucified with Christ* ,
    your sin ** <u>nature</u>**  is without outright or absolute
    power over you. Romans 6:6; Colossians 2:11, 3:1-4
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 3:3b – Paul gave a second reason why we are to * seek* 
for and * set our minds*  on heavenly things. He stated, “    * And your life is ** <u>hidden</u>**  with Christ in God* 
    .”
 
 
    a. This is our present position in Christ and it provides us with amazing
security. This is not only eternal security it is    ** <u>double</u>**  eternal security.
 
 
    b. In Greek Paul used the perfect tense in the phrase * is hidden* .
    This grammar brings out the point that God hid your life at a point in time
    in the ** <u>past</u>**  with results continuing all the way to
    the present.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. In other words, your life has been hidden with Christ in God and it
continues to be hidden all the way up to this very    ** <u>hour</u>** .
 
 
    d. When God hides something, do you think ** <u>anyone</u>** 
    can find it? What about Satan? Can he get into God and find your life to
    steal you away? What about you? Can you find where God has hidden your life
    so as to break in and take it back?
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3. Colossians 3:4a – Paul gave a third reason why we are to * seek* 
    for and * set our minds*  on heavenly things. He stated that Christ is
now our ** <u>life</u>** .    * When Christ, ** who is our life**  is revealed…* 
 
 
    a. John 15:1-5 – Jesus is our source for ** <u>living</u>** .
    Without Christ we can do nothing.
 
 
    b. Philippians 1:21 – Even though Paul considered death to be gain, every
day he lived here below was for Christ and to    ** <u>Christ</u>** . * For to me to live is Christ* …
 
 
    c. Galatians 2:20 – Paul considered his life as a believer as belonging to
    Christ. He said that he no ** <u>longer</u>**  was the one
    living but Christ was living in him.
 
 
d. Colossians 1:27 – Paul passionately revealed the mystery of    * Christ in you, the hope of ** <u>glory</u>** * . He
    wanted believers to know what it means for Christ to live in and through
    the individual.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
4. Colossians 3:4b – Paul’s statement gives us a fourth reason to    * seek*  for and * set our minds*  on heavenly things. We do so
because one day Christ will be ** <u>openly</u>**  manifested.    * When Christ, who is our life ** is revealed** …*  At the
    second coming, Christ will be revealed in all His glory. Romans 2:16,
    Revelation 19:11-16
 
 
5. Colossians 3:4b – Paul’s fifth reason to * seek*  for and    * set our minds*  on heavenly things is because one day when Christ is
revealed we too will be revealed with Him in ** <u>glory</u>** .    * Then you also will be revealed ** with Him in glory** …* 
 
 
    a. There are no conditions ** <u>given</u>**  here. Paul did not
    say, “If you are worthy, you will be revealed with Christ in glory.” The
    truth is that not one of us is worthy. All believers are guaranteed
    glorification because * Christ is our Life.*  There are no
    uncertainties in these words. Romans 8:18-19
 
 
    b. Since we will most certainly be glorified with Christ, let’s not live
    with a focus on the here and now. Don’t live as the unsaved whose destiny
is hell. Let’s live like those who know with certainty that we    ** <u>will</u>**  be with the Lord forever. Philippians 3:18-21
 
 
    c. This world and its enticements are not what we live for. This is not all
there is. We are strangers here. Our citizenship is in    ** <u>heaven</u>** . Since we will one day be with the Lord
    forever, let’s keep focused on heavenly things. When Christ comes to get us
    we will return together with Him in blazing glory. 1 Thess. 4:17-18
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** C. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:5-11 – Therefore * seeking the things above*  and
        having our * minds set on heavenly things* , how are we to now
        live?
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 3:5a – * Therefore* , in light of who you are in
Christ…. We will now shift to see how positional truth affects our    ** <u>walk</u>**  here below. Only to the degree you maintain a
    heavenly focus will you live victoriously here on earth; therefore, you
    must not disregard identification truth.
 
 
    a. You ** <u>died</u>**  with Christ. Colossians 2:20
 
 
    b. You were raised ** up**  together with Christ. Colossians 3:1
 
 
c. You have ** <u>double</u>**  eternal security. …    * hidden with Christ in God. * Colossians 3:3
 
 
d. Your life is summed up in the name “Christ.” …    * when Christ who is our ** <u>life</u>** * … Colossians
    3:4a
 
 
e. You ** <u>will</u>**  be glorified, guaranteed.    * Then you also will be revealed with him in glory* … Colossians 3:4b
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    * 2. * 
    Colossians 3:5b – * Consider …as dead… * The command here is to
    literally ** * <u>make</u>* ** *  dead* . The Greek
    word for “* consider…as dead* ” NEKROO is an aorist, active,
    imperative verb. 
 
 
a. The verb NEKROO means make as dead, deprive of    ** <u>power</u>**  or put to death. 
 
 
    b. In using an aorist imperative versus the present imperative, Paul was
    commanding the believers to decisively do this action versus habitually
doing it. In this case, it might be understood as get    ** <u>rid</u>**  of it (kill it) as opposed to stop doing it
    (quit it).
    <br/>
    <br/>
     
 
 
    c. Clearly Paul based his command on what he just said about being
    positionally ** <u>dead</u>**  with Christ. * Therefore, * 
    based on that fact, * put to death, * or by faith apply death to the
    members of your bodies. Colossians 3:3
 
 
    1) Short of amputation, the only way you can make the members of your body
    dead is to do it by ** <u>faith</u>** . Paul is not going back
    on his previous teaching and now teaching a form of asceticism.
 
 
    2) When you * consider the members of your earthly body as dead* , you
    apply in a practical way the positional truth of your death with Christ to
sin, to your present condition – to your daily walk here on this    ** <u>earth</u>** . Romans 6:2, 11
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
3) Putting to death the members of your earthly body involves cutting    ** <u>off</u>**  the stream of influence between the sin nature
    and your physical body. You do this by faith in what God has already done.
    Romans 6:6-8a, 2 Timothy 2:11
 
 
4) You (the person inside your body) are dead to sin, so by faith    ** <u>count</u>**  your body as being dead to sin as well. Like
    a dead person, you are not to offer the parts of your body to sin to become
    sin’s slave again. You are to offer the parts of your body to God as
    instruments of righteousness. Romans 6:12-13
 
 
    5) To interpret this as anything other than a faith issue would mean Paul
    was saying to ** <u>murder</u>**  your body. That would be
    nothing short of the severe asceticism Paul spoke directly against in
    Colossians 2:20-23.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3. Colossians 3:5c – Let's take a look at your body in
    relation to immoral sins. To what are we to consider the members of our
    earthly body as being dead? Paul spoke out against believers being involved
in a number of disgraceful sins. By faith we are to make our    ** <u>body</u>**  dead to the following sins.
 
 
    a. Paul addressed some reprehensible ** <u>sins</u>**  that
    obviously a believer could, but should not ever, do. If it were impossible
    for believers to get caught up in these sins, as some people teach, Paul
    wasted his time in teaching against them.
 
 
    1) * Immorality*  PORNEIA engulfs a ** <u>large</u>**  area
    of sexual deviations including premarital sex, adultery, homosexuality,
    incest, bestiality, prostitution and all forms of pornography.
 
 
    2) * Impurity*  AKATHARSIA is a broad term referring to moral
    filthiness in thought, word or deed. The impure or unclean person focuses
    on the ** <u>dirty</u>**  side of everything.
 
 
3) * Passion*  PATHOS describes sin’s depraved cravings or repulsive    ** <u>drives</u>** .
 
 
    4) * Evil desires*  is a phrase that designates totally impure
    cravings or a hunger for that which is ** <u>vile</u>** .
 
 
5) * Greed*  PLEONEXIA is a compound word in Greek that means have-    ** <u>more</u>** .
 
 
6) * Greed, which is idolatry* … God equates    ** <u>greed</u>**  with idolatry.
 
 
a) In reality * idolatry*  is the worship of an    ** <u>object</u>**  for personal advantage.
 
 
    b) In * idolatry*  you give service (burn a candle, make a promise,
give something, etc.) to an object of worship (image, statue or    ** <u>icon</u>** ) if you can get something in return
    (advantage, promotion, health or wealth) from that object.
 
 
    c) According to ** <u>God</u>**  the pursuit of idolatry is
    nothing more than pure greed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Let's consider some ** <u>thoughts</u>**  on these sins of
    the body.
 
 
    1) Each of these moral ** <u>ills</u>**  represents an intense
    emotional pull, with extreme passion, lack of restraint, physical or mental
    abandonment, or complete immersion.
 
 
    2) Since your body is a neutral entity, it ultimately becomes a slave of
    the one to whom you ** <u>present</u>**  it. The body can become
    a slave of sin or a slave to the Lord. Romans 6:12-23
 
 
    3) The human body is not the cause of ** <u>sin</u>** .
 
 
    a) Even though your body is under the ** <u>curse</u>**  of
    Genesis 3, and is groaning as it waits for the day of redemption (Rom.
    8:23), it is still the temple of God’s Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 6:19-20
 
 
    b) Since God made your body His ** <u>temple</u>** , logically
    your body is not intrinsically evil (Gnosticism).
 
 
    c) Simply put, your ** <u>body</u>**  is like a vessel that is
    either being filled by God the Holy Spirit or by the fleshly nature.
    Galatians 5:16-17
 
 
    4) Romans 8:12-13 – Therefore, by means of faith in God’s Holy Spirit, you
should put to death the deeds of the body. If you do so, you will    ** <u>live</u>** .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4. Colossians 3:6-7 – Why not present our bodies to sin?
    Paul gave ** <u>two</u>**  very practical reasons why we should
    put the members of our bodies to death in relation to sin.
 
 
    a. Colossians 3:6 – Paul's ** <u>first</u>**  reason for why we
    should avoid the sins that he just mentioned is because of impending
    judgment on those who are characterized by such sins.
 
 
1) Colossians 3:6a – ** * Because of these things* **     *  the wrath of God is coming… * The unsaved, the ones who give
    themselves over to these kinds of sins, will ** <u>not</u>** 
    escape the coming wrath of God. Romans 1:18, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11,
    Galatians 5:21
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) Colossians 3:6b –
    * 
Because of these things the wrath of God is coming        ** on the sons of disobedience** 
    * 
    . The phrase * on the ** <u>sons</u>**  of disobedience* 
    is key to understanding Paul’s warning. The * sons of disobedience* 
    refers to the unsaved world and not to saints. Ephesians 2:1-3
 
 
a) Thankfully Scriptures testify that God’s children are guaranteed to    ** <u>escape</u>**  * the coming wrath * of God. John 3:36;
    Romans 5:9; 1 Thessalonians 1:10, 5:9
 
 
    b) Paul was saying that as saints we should ** <u>never</u>** 
    be found involved in the sins that the * sons of disobedience* , the
    unsaved of the world who will be judged under the wrath of God, do as a way
    of life. Romans 6:20-23, Ephesians 5:6
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 3:7 – Paul gave a ** <u>second</u>**  reason for
    not getting involved in the sins listed in verse five. We should avoid
    these sins because they describe things that we did, but they do not
    describe who we are now.
 
 
    1) Colossians 3:7a – * And*  * in them * (among those who commit
    such evil sins)*  you also once ** <u>walked</u>** * … We
    understand that these evils were part of our old manner of life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2) Colossians 3:7b –    * When you were ** <u>living</u>**  in them…*  There was
    once a time when we lived as part of those who commit such sins. Those
    kinds of sins are part of our old way of life and not who we are today.
    Romans 6:20-23
 
 
    a) Paul did not imply by this statement that believers couldn’t commit
    these types of ** <u>sins</u>** .
 
 
    b) If it were impossible for believers to do the sins listed in verse 5,
Paul would not have taught the Colossians to put such things to    ** <u>death</u>** .
 
 
c) In the very next verse Paul went on to insist that we** <u>put</u>**  such things away from our lives.    * But now you also, put them all aside* … Colossians 2:8a
 
 
    5. Colossians 3:8-9a – Paul moved on to
    another list of sins we should ** <u>remove</u>**  from our
    lives. We can call these evils temperament sins.
 
 
a. Colossians 3:8a –     * But now you also, put them all aside* … Although these sins all
    belonged to our former manner of life, we tend to allow them as “acceptable
sins” in our lives and churches. Paul said to put them off and lay them    ** <u>aside</u>** , together with all the sins listed in verse
    five.
 
 
b. Colossians 3:8b –    **  * <u>Wrath</u>* ** , ORGE in Greek, describes the
    smoldering, long-term emotion that eventually boils forth in viciousness.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 3:8c –    **  * <u>Anger</u>* **  THUMOS is an impulsive emotion. It
    is a red-hot ember ready to burst into flames at the slightest provocation.
    Provocation does not produce this anger, but beware, it will reveal it.
 
 
d. Colossians 3:8d –    **  * <u>Malice</u>* **  KAKIA is a spiteful attitude that
    has as its goal vengeance and harm to others.
 
 
e. Colossians 3:8e –    **  * <u>Slander</u>* **  BLASPHEMIA is making false
    charges that misrepresent and defame others. It is to verbally destroy
    someone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
f. Colossians 3:8f –    **  * <u>Abusive</u> speech* **  AISCHROLOGIA includes
    everything from words spoken in poor taste to obscenity and dirty language.
    Ephesians 5:4
 
 
    g. Colossians 3:9a – ** * Do not <u>lie</u>* **  ME
    PSEUDOMAI is the final statement in this list of sins and is
    self-explanatory.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    h. How can we effectively lay ** <u>aside</u>**  all these sins?
 
 
    1) First of all, it is ** <u>not</u>**  through human reasoning,
    self-imposed religion, mystical experiences, or the spiritual disciplines
    that we will lay them aside. These methods were all condemned as
    ineffective in the previous chapter.
 
 
    2) The true solution to ** <u>all</u>**  sin is to actively
    depend in faith on our death with Christ to sin and our resurrection with
    Him to newness of life and then on that basis to present our bodies to God
    for His use. Romans 6:1-13
 
 
    6. Colossians 3:9b-11 – Paul gave some positive reasons not to indulge in
    the ** <u>sins</u>**  of the flesh. 
 
 
a. Colossians 3:9b –    * Since you ** <u>laid</u>**  aside the old self* … We
    already * laid aside*  the * old self*  at the day of our
    salvation. Romans 6:6a
 
 
    1) The ** <u>old</u>**  self (also called the old man) is your
    old identity; it is who you were in Adam.
 
 
    2) When you were born, you were born into the wrong family. You were born
    in ** <u>Adam</u>** ; therefore, before salvation you were
    identified with fallen Adam.
 
 
    3) In your original hopeless relationship with Adam, God rejected you.
    Ephesians 1:1-3
 
 
    4) Then at the moment you were born again, you * laid aside*  the old
self. Your old rejected self was crucified with Christ and ceased to    ** <u>exist</u>** . Romans 6:6a
 
 
a) Here * laid aside*  APEKDUOMAI means to completely    ** <u>undress</u>** . APO means away from and EKDYO means
    stripped off. It is likely that Paul coined this word since it is not found
    in Greek writings previous to the time of Paul.
 
 
    b) The word * laid aside*  APEKDUOMAI in this verse is different from
    the word ** * <u>put</u>* ** *  off*  APOTITHEMI used
    in verse 8.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c) In verse 8 we were told to * put off*  specific sins but the word    * laid aside*  here is not saying to put off the * old self* .
Quite the contrary. It is stating this as an already accomplished    ** <u>fact</u>** .
 
 
    d) The verb * laid aside*  is an aorist, middle voice participle
    implying something that was already ** <u>done</u>**  at a point
    in time in the past and was done to you not by you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    e) The ** <u>force</u>**  of the word * laid aside* 
    describes the fact that at salvation God ripped off of you your old
    identity in Adam (the * old self or old man* ) and therefore that
    person no longer exists. Your * old self*  was crucified with Christ.
    Romans 6:6
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5) God stripped you of your * old self*  so that your sin nature (also
    called the * flesh*  or * indwelling sin* ) might be rendered
    powerless ** <u>over</u>**  you. Romans 6:6b, 7:17-20
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Colossians 3:9c – Since you have    * laid aside the old self with its evil practices*  (your old identity
    in Adam no longer exists)* ,*  you should never go back and indulge
    the ** <u>flesh</u>**  with either its sins of immorality or
    sins of temperament. Colossians 3:5, 3:8-9a
 
 
    1) Again, why should you and I as believers not sin? To answer this, Paul
    predictably returned to a positional (identification) argument: “Because
    when we ** <u>died</u>**  with Christ, we were stripped of our
    old identity in Adam.” Romans 6:1-11
 
 
    2) Colossians 3:5 –
    * 
Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as        ** <u>dead</u>** 
    * 
    …
 
 
    3) Romans 6:2b – * How shall we who died to sin still live in it* ?
 
 
    c. Colossians 3:10a – * And have put on the new self* … You have
already been clothed with the ** * <u>new</u>* **     *  self.* 
 
 
1) Your * new self*  is the new person you are    ** <u>now</u>**  in Christ. As far as God is concerned, the old
    you is dead and gone. You have a new identity. You have * put on* 
    ENDUO * the new self* . Romans 5:12-18
 
 
    a) * Put on*  ENDUO means to ** <u>dress</u>**  in. It is a
    compound word in Greek that literally means to sink into.
 
 
    b) Here the word is an aorist, middle voice participle that shows that this
    action already happened to you at a point in time in the past and it was
done to you not by you. At the point of salvation,    ** <u>God</u>**  dressed you in your * new self* .
 
 
    2) Your new self came into being the ** <u>moment</u>**  you
    believed in Christ and were born again. 1 Peter 1:3, 23
 
 
    3) At the moment of salvation, you were born again into the family of God.
Through death you left Adam’s lineage and by    ** <u>rebirth</u>**  you were joined to Christ’s lineage. John
    3:3-8
 
 
4) You are now a new creation and eternally related to Jesus Christ by    ** <u>birth</u>**  (rebirth). 2 Corinthians 5:14-18, 1 Peter
    1:3, 23
 
 
    5) Since you have * put on the new self* , don’t indulge in the sins
    of the ** <u>flesh</u>** .
 
 
    d. Colossians 3:10b –
    * 
Put on the new self        ** who is being renewed to a true knowledge** 
    * 
… Your * new self* , or the new you, is designed by    ** <u>God</u>**  to be refreshed and renewed on an ongoing
    basis. Romans 7:22, 2 Corinthians 4:16, Ephesians 4:22-24
 
 
1) * …who is being renewed* … This renewal is something    ** <u>God</u>**  Himself does to us, and it is something He
    desires to do on a continual and ongoing basis.
 
 
    2) * …to a true knowledge… * This literally reads “which is being
renewed ** * in* **     *  ** <u>true</u>**  knowledge* .” In other words, as you
    personally fellowship with Christ, you will daily be renewed in your
    beliefs. 2 Corinthians 3:18; 2 Peter 1:3, 3:18
 
 
e. Colossians 10c –    * …according to the image of the One who created him* . God planned
    for you to live the Christian life by needing consistent, ongoing, personal
    and intimate fellowship with ** <u>Jesus</u>**  Christ.
 
 
1) God designed the * new self*  to constantly    ** <u>be</u>**  refreshed and renewed into Christ’s likeness. As
    this happens, you grow. 2 Corinthians 3:18
 
 
    2) If you continually live according to the flesh, committing the sins
    listed above, you are ** <u>not</u>**  going to grow in the true
    knowledge of Christ and you will not daily be refreshed or renewed.
    Ephesians 4:17-24
 
 
    3) You need a consistent walk of fellowship with Jesus Christ because it is
    only then that you are refreshed, encouraged and edified in this life. Of
    course, this growth ** <u>starts</u>**  with understanding your
    identification in Christ with His death and resurrection. Colossians 2:20;
    3:1-4
 
 
f. Colossians 3:11a –    * A ** <u>renewal</u>**  in which there is no distinction* 
    … Lest we become self-righteous, Paul gave a list of diversities to show
that there really are no differences among those who are    ** * in Christ* ** .
 
 
    1) * There is no distinction between Greek and Jew…* 
 
 
    a) The Greeks were the ** <u>social</u>**  elite class in New
    Testament times. Paul said that what mattered was the * new self*  not
    pop-culture.
 
 
    b) The Jews were the ** <u>religious</u>**  elite of the day.
    Jewish people felt they were the only people in the world who could know
    God. Paul said that what mattered was the * new self*  not some
    religious affiliation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) * There is no distinction between… circumcised and uncircumcised* …
    Galatians 6:15
 
 
    a) The circumcised referred to those who thought they had God's approval
    because of the ** <u>ritual</u>**  of circumcision.
 
 
b) Uncircumcised was a term of disparity given by circumcised Jews to the    ** <u>rest</u>**  of humanity. It designated them as less than
    pure or holy and distanced from God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) * There is no distinction between… Barbarian, Scythian* …
 
 
a) Barbarian was a term for anyone who did not    ** <u>speak</u>**  the Greek language. With time barbarian
acquired the connotation of brutish or rude. What mattered was the    * new self*  not education or language.
 
 
    b) Scythians were a ** <u>group</u>**  described by the Greek
    historian Herodotus (BC 500) as a people who lived in wagons, offered human
    sacrifices, scalped, and even sometimes carved up, the bodies of their
    slain enemies.
 
 
c) Herodotus said that the Scythians drank the    ** <u>blood</u>**  of their enemies and used their skulls for
    drinking-cups.
 
 
    d) Paul would say that what mattered was the * new self* , not being a
    cut above the ** <u>savages</u>**  of this world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4)
    * 
        There is no distinction between… ** slave**  and freeman
    * 
    …
 
 
    a) Slaves were the ** <u>lowest</u>**  class of humans in Greek
    society. Having this lot in life held great scorn. Paul stated that what
    mattered was the * new man*  and not status or lack thereof.
 
 
    b) In Greek society, freemen were considered to be real people, and they
alone enjoyed rights. Paul would say that neither    ** <u>liberty</u>**  nor the lack of liberty is what matters
    because in Christ we are all free. Galatians 5:1
 
 
    5) Paul's concluded that for the Christian ** <u>none</u>**  of
    these things held any significance on the one hand or impediment on the
    other.
 
 
    a) God sees only ** <u>two</u>**  kinds of people in this world:
    those who are * in Christ*  and those who are still * in Adam* .
 
 
    b) Within the body of Christ, we are all on ** <u>level</u>** 
    ground. Galatians 3:26-28
 
 
    g. Colossians 3:11b – * But Christ is all, and in all* . Christ, as
    sovereign God, is adequate for ** <u>all</u>**  our needs.
 
 
    1) * Christ ** is all** …*  Christ is everything to us, and
    He is all that really matters. Because of Christ, God defines us as His
    children. My level of education, my race, my social status or economic
    state is not what defines me. Christ defines * who*  I am. Christ
    alone ** <u>gives</u>**  me significance.
 
 
2) * Christ is all ** and in all** …*  Christ lives in our    ** <u>lives</u>** . He lives IN every believer without
    exception, no matter what our particular condition or status. Christ being
    in us gives us true significance. Ephesians 4:4-5, Colossians 3:3
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** V. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:12-17 – Changed Person: Living a New Life as a New Person
    ** 
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:12 – Paul made <u>three</u> amazing statements about the
        new you.
    ** 
 
 
    1. * So, as those who have been ** chosen**  of God* … As a
    believer in Christ you are a ** <u>chosen</u>**  EKLEKTOS
    (called out one) of God. By means of the Gospel, God called you forth from
    the vile world system in which you were mired down and ensnared. Colossians
    1:21
 
 
    a. This word EKLEKTOS is ** <u>never</u>**  used of unbelievers.
    It is a doctrine that belongs exclusively to those who are saved.
 
 
    b. This is a position of extreme ** <u>honor</u>**  and reflects
    the special place we have in God’s sight because of our union with Christ,
    God’s Elect One. Ephesians 1:4, 1 Peter 1:20
 
 
    2. * So, as those who have been chosen of God, ** holy** * 
    … You are one of God’s ** <u>holy</u>**  ones. God already
    considers you to be set apart from the profane and godless world system. 1
    Corinthians 1:30, 1 Peter 2:9
 
 
    3.
    * 
So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and        ** beloved** 
    * 
… Whether or not you accept it as a fact, you are a dearly    ** <u>loved</u>**  one of God. Romans 8:31-39, 1 John 3:1-2
 
 
    a. * Beloved*  is a perfect tense participle emphasizing that not only
    were you loved in the ** <u>past</u>** , you continue on in that
    state in the present. God’s love for you is unconditional and unending.
 
 
    b. Being chosen, holy and beloved, how should we live?
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:12b-14 – In what should you dress the new you?
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 3:12b –**  * Put on* ** 
    * 
        a ** <u>heart</u>**  of compassion, kindness, humility,
        gentleness and patience
    * 
    … * Put on*  ENDUO is a middle voice aorist imperative that literally
    means sink into. Figuratively we might say, “Let yourself be clothed in
    these.”
 
 
    a. * A heart of ** <u>mercy</u>** *  conveys compassion,
    tenderhearted love, pity and tender mercy toward others.
 
 
    b. * Kindness*  refers to ** <u>kind</u>**  feelings,
    honest goodness and nonthreatening goodwill toward everyone in your world.
 
 
    c. * Humility*  speaks of a ** <u>deep</u>**  sense of your
    own personal smallness, being truly modest as opposed to being arrogant.
 
 
d. * Gentleness*  conveys a mild-mannered disposition and    ** <u>quiet</u>**  strength.
 
 
e. * Patience*  speaks of discipline, the    ** <u>power</u>**  to undergo any suffering, a reluctance to
    avenge wrongs and endurance.
 
 
f. It is God who provides these graces as a true    ** <u>garment</u>** , and our part is to allow them to become
    ours.
 
 
    1) Before listing off these ** <u>graces</u>** , Paul clarified
    how to and how not to be godly.
 
 
    2) These graces do ** <u>not</u>**  come through philosophy,
    legalism, mysticism or asceticism.
 
 
    3) As you walk by ** <u>faith</u>**  in Christ, the Spirit of
    God will readily produce these in your life. Galatians 5:22-23
 
 
    4) It is your ** <u>job</u>**  to actively present yourself to
    God by faith and to not present yourself to the old nature. Romans 6:12-14
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2. Colossians 3:13a – ** * <u>Bearing</u>* **     *  with one another* … As God’s chosen, holy and loved ones, we are
    also told to ** put up with**  one another.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3. Colossians 3:13b –
    * 
        And forgiving one another just as the Lord forgave you, so also should
        you.
    * 
As God’s chosen, holy and loved ones, we are to ** put on** ,    ** put up with**  and ** put <u>right</u>**  all
    relationships. Matthew 18:21-22
 
 
a. * And forgiving one another… * Unforgiveness is such a    ** <u>killer</u>** . Unforgiveness leads to bitterness and
    bitterness leads to more unforgiveness. It’s a cancer that will eat you
    alive. Hebrews 12:15
 
 
b.    * Just as the Lord forgave you, ** so also should you** .* 
    We are told to forgive in the ** <u>same</u>**  way that Christ
    has forgiven us. Luke 5:20-24; Romans 5:8, 17-19
 
 
1) In the cross Jesus Christ personally forgave us    ** <u>more</u>**  sins that we committed against Him than could
    possibly be committed against us by anyone else. Romans 4:7-8, 1 John 2:12
 
 
    2) Jesus Christ eternally forgave all ** <u>sins</u>**  before
    any one of us could possibly ask, and that forgiveness was applied to our
    account the moment we believed. Romans 5:8; Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:14,
    2:13
 
 
    3) In light of ** <u>Christ’s</u>**  unconditional forgiveness
    of all our sins, we should willingly forgive anyone against whom we have a
    complaint. 2 Corinthians 5:19, Luke 23:34
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4. Colossians 3:14 – Finally and
    * 
        beyond all these things put on ** <u>love</u>** , which is
        the perfect bond of unity
    * 
    . As God’s chosen, holy and loved ones, we are to put on, over and above
    all else, the mantle of love. Galatians 5:22a
 
 
    a. Above all else, you should be wearing love as an overcoat.
    * 
But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the        ** greatest**  of these is ** <u>love</u>** .
    * 
    1 Corinthians 13:13
 
 
b. Love is the superglue, the    * perfect ** <u>bond</u>**  of unity* , that holds us all
    together as believers. Unity is love in action.
    <br/>

    ** C. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:15-17 – * Let*  some important things happen to the
        new you
    ** 
     
 
 
1. Colossians 3:15 – The first “let” command:    ** * Let* ** 
    * 
        the peace of Christ ** <u>rule</u>**  in your hearts, to
        which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful.
    * 
 
 
a. Colossians 3:15a – The command is to    ** <u>let</u>**  peace rule. Don’t stop or disallow peace from
    ruling in your hearts.
 
 
    1) When you have a “** <u>let</u>** ” command in Scripture, it
    is typically translating a passive voice imperative verb in Greek.
 
 
2) The imperative tense means you have a command to    ** <u>obey</u>** . The passive voice indicates that you are to
    allow or permit it to happen, not to make it happen.
 
 
    3) The difference might be understood in a mother who says to a squirming
    child, “Let me ** <u>dress</u>**  you,” versus the command, “Get
    dressed.”
 
 
    4) Paul was saying that Christ’s peace wants to govern in your life and you
are to permit it to happen. This is not a directive to    ** <u>create</u>**  peace; it is a directive to not stop the
    peace of Christ from governing in your life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 3:15b – Paul said for the Colossian
    believers to ** <u>allow</u>**  the peace that Christ gives to
    be a mediator BRABEUO (* rule* ) in their hearts.
 
 
    1) We all know from personal experience that peace is not natural to the
    human experience. We all struggle with ** <u>fears</u>** ,
    anxiety and worries. Our hearts are prone to turmoil. Romans 3:17
 
 
    a) The prophet Jeremiah exclaimed, “The human heart is
    * 
        …more ** <u>deceitful</u>**  than all else and is
        desperately sick; who can understand it
    * 
    ?” Jeremiah 17:9
 
 
    b) Psalm 139:23 –
    * 
Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me and know my        ** <u>anxious</u>**  thoughts; and see if there be any
        hurtful way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.”
        <br/>
        <br/>
    * 
 
 
    2) God has made Christ’s ** <u>peace</u>**  available to us.
    Jesus told His disciples, “
    * 
        Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives
        do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be
        fearful
    * 
    .” John 14:27
 
 
    a) God gives peace to those who entrust their ** <u>cares</u>** 
    to Him. Philippians 4:6-7, 1 Peter 5:7
 
 
    b) Isaiah 26:3 –
    * 
        The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, because he trusts
        in ** <u>You</u>** 
    * 
    .
 
 
    c) Jesus promised to give rest to all the ** <u>weary</u>**  who
    trust in Him. Matthew 11:28-30
 
 
    3) For these reasons, under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, Paul
prevailed on the believers in Colossae to allow Christ’s    ** <u>peace</u>**  to arbitrate in their hearts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Colossians 3:15b –
    * 
Let the peace of Christ rule…to which indeed you were called in        ** <u>one</u>**  body
    * 
    .
 
 
    1) If we were each an ** <u>island</u>**  to ourselves it might
    not matter if we enjoyed peace in our hearts. Turmoil would be considered a
    private sin that doesn’t hurt anyone but us personally. This Scripture
    indicates just the opposite. It does matter corporately if individually we
    have peace or not.
 
 
    2) As members of the body of Christ, we are to build each other up. We are
    to not destroy each other nor cause others to ** <u>doubt</u>** 
    the Lord. Ephesians 4:16
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Your ** <u>sins</u>**  affect the body of Christ. If you are
    worried, fretting and not trusting the Lord, it affects others around you.
    Psalm 37:8
 
 
4) Anytime you walk according to the flesh, it negatively impacts the    ** <u>body</u>**  of Christ. Galatians 6:7-8
 
 
    5) A lack of peace communicates a lack of ** <u>trust</u>**  in
    the goodness and sovereignty of God, and just like gossip or bitterness, it
    becomes a virus that invades the whole church. 1 John 4:18
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Colossians 3:15d –
    * 
        Let the peace of Christ rule …and be ** <u>thankful</u>** 
    * 
    . Psalm 100:4
 
 
    1) To compliment the command to let the ** <u>peace</u>**  of
    Christ rule, Paul further commanded the Colossians to be thankful. To be
    continually thankful is a present tense command.
 
 
    2) Thankfulness naturally springs forth as a response to the internal peace
    that Christ ** <u>gives</u>** .
 
 
    3) When we ** <u>fail</u>**  to count our blessings through
    thanksgiving, bitterness naturally prevails in our thinking.
 
 
    a) To counteract despair, Paul encouraged the Thessalonians saying, “
    * 
        In everything ** <u>give</u>**  thanks for this is God’s
        will for you in Christ Jesus
    * 
    .” 1 Thessalonians 5:18
 
 
    b) Giving thanks * in everything*  includes verbal appreciation for
    the good, the bad and the ** <u>ugly</u>** . Romans 5:3
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 3:16-17 – Paul’s second “let” command:
    * 
        Let the ** <u>Word</u>**  of Christ richly dwell within you
    * 
    …
 
 
    a. Colossians 3:16a –
    * 
        Let the Word of Christ richly ** <u>dwell</u>**  within you
    * 
    is an opulent statement.
 
 
    1) The word ** * <u>dwell</u>* **  ENOIKEO is a compound
    word made up of EN meaning in and OIKEO to dwell. It means to inhabit as in
    a residence. Figuratively it communicated the idea of influencing by
    proximity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) The question could be asked, “What will ultimately influence your heart
and mind?” Paul commanded the Colossian believers to    ** <u>allow</u>**  Christ's Word to influence their hearts.
 
 
    a) Let the Word of Christ dwell richly in you means God wants you to allow
    Christ’s words to ** <u>invade</u>**  your life in such a
    meaningful way that they end up changing you. 2 Corinthians 3:18
 
 
    b) God is not satisfied with Christ’s words simply being in your mind in an
academic way; He wants them to have a profound    ** <u>impact</u>**  on your life. James 1:22-24
 
 
    c)
    * 
        Let the Word of Christ richly ** <u>dwell</u>**  within you…
    * 
can essentially be understood as a synonym for    * be filled with the Spirit*  as seen in a comparison of Ephesians
    5:18-21 with Colossians 3:16-17.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) In Ephesians 3:15-17, Paul made this issue a matter of prayer. He prayed
that Christ Himself might influence them by being completely at    ** <u>home</u>**  in their lives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Colossians 3:16c-17 – When the Word of Christ    ** <u>richly</u>**  dwells within you, it is in essence Christ
    at ease, residing in your life. Ephesians 3:17, 5:18-21
 
 
1) Colossians 3:16c –    * With all wisdom ** <u>teaching</u>**  one another…* 
    First of all, having the Word of Christ at home in your heart will
revolutionize your way of teaching.    ** Your message will be changed** . Proverbs 10:31-32, 31:26
 
 
    a) To ** <u>teach</u>**  is to pass on truth in an ordered
    manner so that God’s people can be edified. 2 Timothy 4:2
 
 
b) Teaching is typically a positive method of communicating the    ** <u>truth</u>**  to others. Having the Word of God abound in
    your life gives you a constructive message. Proverbs 2:6, 1 Timothy 4:13
 
 
2) Colossians 3:16b  – …    * with all wisdom… ** admonishing**  one another* .
Secondly, with the Word of Christ presiding over your life,** your way of correcting others will <u>change</u>**     ** dramatically** .
 
 
a) When the words of Christ dwell in you richly, you are then ready to    ** <u>warn</u>** , rebuke and correct others in all wisdom as
    necessary. Proverbs 2:6
 
 
    b) Fellow believers do not always eagerly receive admonishment but by
letting the words of Christ abound in your heart,    ** <u>God</u>**  will empower you in this corrective ministry.
 
 
    3) Colossians 3:16e  – Thirdly, having the Word of
Christ dominant in your life**  will change your tune** . Your    ** <u>singing</u>**  to God will be affected.
 
 
    a) You’ll be singing with ** <u>psalms</u>** . Written to be
    sung with a stringed instrument like the harp, psalms PSALMOS were Israel’s
    songs of worship. The book of Psalms was a collection of the most common
    songs of Israel. Psalm 42 “As the Deer” is an example of a psalm we sing
    today.
 
 
    b) You’ll be singing with ** <u>hymns</u>** . Before
    Christianity, hymns HUMNOS were anthems, sacred songs or ballads sung to
    commemorate heroes, gods or conquerors. Songs like “How Great Thou Art”
    fall into this genre. Some have dubbed these types of songs high praise.
 
 
    c) You’ll be singing with ** spiritual <u>songs</u>**  or
    spiritual odes. ODE is the Greek word for song (Rev. 5:9). Greek odes were
    poems that were sung. Typically odes expressed deep feelings. Praise and
    worship music would most aptly fit this category.
 
 
    d) You’ll be * singing …** <u>with</u>**  thankfulness* .
    The starting point of true worship is gratitude.
 
 
    e) You’ll be * singing …in your ** <u>hearts</u>** *  and
    not just with your lips. True worship flows out of the heart. Letting the
    Word of Christ reside in your heart will produce genuine worship.
 
 
    f) You’ll be * singing …to God* . With the Word of Christ prevailing
    in your heart you will not be singing for the guy in the next pew. You’ll
    be singing for God’s sake, God’s ** <u>ears</u>**  and God’s
    glory alone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4) Colossians 3:17a – Fourthly, with the Word of Christ ruling in your
    heart ** your work ethic will be altered** . You’ll learn to
    labor for ** <u>God’s</u>**  glory and not man’s hollow praise.
 
 
    a) When he said, “* Whatever you do in word or deed* ,” Paul was
emphasizing how the Word of Christ in our hearts will influence    ** <u>all</u>**  our ** actions** . This shows that
    compartmentalization or Sunday Christianity is pure hypocrisy.
 
 
b) When Paul said ** * <u>do</u>* **     *  all in the name of the Lord Jesus* … he showed the true motivation
we are to have all day, every day. This emphasizes how our    ** attitudes**  can be transformed as the Word of Christ
    saturates our thinking.
 
 
    (i) In an effort to protect their ** <u>image</u>**  many
    Christians are not honest and transparent. They go through the motions of
    spirituality to look good on the outside, but their motivations are wrong.
 
 
(ii) When we simply go through the motions of the Christian life instead of* doing all in the name of the Lord Jesus*  in order to    ** <u>please</u>**  God, we deceive others, but even more
    disastrously we cheat ourselves of the real purpose of life, bringing glory
    to God. 2 Peter 1:8-11
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
5) Colossians 3:17b – Fifthly, as the Word of Christ permeates our thinking** our appreciation for the <u>Lord</u> will change** .    * Giving thanks through Him to God the Father* . We’ll develop an
    attitude of gratitude.
    <br/>

    ** VI.** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:18-4:1 – Changed Relationships Through the Word of Christ
    ** 
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:18 – Teaching for the believing wife (Eph. 5:22-24, 33;
    ** 
    ** 1 Pet. 3:1-6)** 
 
 
    1. General comment
 
 
    a. What Paul taught is in stark contrast to paganism in which the husband
    was typically lord of the household and considered above the mundane tasks
    of running a ** <u>home</u>** . The daily duties and
    responsibilities of the home rested on wives and slaves.
 
 
b. Conversely, in Christianity, although the husband is the    ** <u>head</u>**  of the home, the daily responsibilities for
    the household depend on both the husband and wife.
 
 
    2. Colossians 3:18 – Teaching for the Christian wife
 
 
a. Colossians 3:18a – ** * Wives* **     * , be subject to your husbands* … The biblical standard is for wives
    to voluntarily subject themselves to their ** <u>own</u>** 
    husbands.
 
 
    1) In Paul’s teachings on the Christian family in Colossians, it is
    noteworthy that he gave only ** <u>one</u>**  verse of
    instruction directly to wives.
 
 
    2) Paul presented the role of the Christian ** <u>wife</u>**  in
    a straightforward, uncomplicated manner. We do well to follow his example.
 
 
b. Colossians 3:18b – * Wives**  be subject** * …* Be subject*  HUPOTASSO a compound word that was standard    ** <u>military</u>**  jargon. There is no weakness conveyed in
    this expression at all.
 
 
    1) This word HUPOTASSO means to willingly put yourself in full battle array
    as though prepared for ** <u>war</u>** . The Christian wife is
    to array herself battle-ready, under the authority of her husband.
 
 
    a) There is no greater form of ** <u>faith</u>**  than when a
    wife willingly entrusts herself to God by entrusting herself to the
    leadership of a fallen man like her own husband.
 
 
    b) Submission is truly an act of faith or ** <u>trust</u>** . Is
    the wife willing to trust the Lord and take her stand under the authority
    of her husband? That is biblical submission.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) Biblical submission does ** <u>not</u>**  mean mindlessness.
    The word submission implies that there will be differing opinions. In
    moments of disagreement when a decision must be made, God calls for the
    wife to willingly trust her husband’s decision.
 
 
    3) There is ** <u>nothing</u>**  demeaning about biblical
    submission. The Christian wife is to submit to her husband in the same way
    Christ submits to His Father. We would never consider Jesus demeaned by His
    willing subjection to the Father. 1 Corinthians 3:23, 11:3; Matthew 26:39,
    42
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 3:18c –    * Wives, be subject ** to your husbands** * … This verse is
    not teaching that women should submit to ** <u>men</u>**  in
    general.
 
 
    1) This does not speak of an inferior position, status or significance.
    Wives are fellow heirs with their husbands of the grace of God. (1 Pet.
    3:7) Women have equal status and ** <u>value</u>**  in the body
    of Christ with men. Galatians 3:28
 
 
    2) This is also ** <u>not</u>**  teaching that women cannot hold
    public offices or be the president of a corporation. There is nothing like
    that implied in this verse.
 
 
3) This is teaching that the believing wife of her own** <u>will</u>**  is to choose to subject herself to    ** her**  own husband.
 
 
    d. Colossians 3:18a – An important understanding of a believing wife’s duty
is incrusted in the statement    * as is fitting ** <u>in</u>**  the Lord* .
 
 
1) * As is fitting*  ANEKO means appropriate or    ** <u>suitable</u>** .
 
 
2) * In the * Lord speaks of the daughter of God, who because she    ** <u>belongs</u>**  to the Lord, submits to her own husband.
    Indeed, in like manner, Christ, her supreme example, willingly subjected
    Himself to the Father.
 
 
    a) When a believing wife ** <u>willingly</u>**  and actively
    submits to her own husband, it is greatly honoring to Christ.
 
 
    b) In Titus 2:5, speaking of the wife of the deacon, Paul further
    illustrated this:
    * 
Being subject to their ** <u>own</u>**  husbands,        ** so that the word of God will not be dishonored** 
    * 
    .
 
 
    c) The believing wife who understands God’s ** <u>order</u>** ,
    plan and purpose for her in marriage knows that her ultimate happiness is
    found only in willingly fulfilling God’s design.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
3. Ephesians 5:22-24, 33 – To complement our study concerning the believing    ** <u>wife</u>**  we will now add Paul’s parallel teaching for
    wives from the book of Ephesians.
 
 
a. Ephesians 5:22 – Here again we see the biblical rule:    * Wives be subject to your ** <u>own</u> ** husbands* .
 
 
    1) Here the command is essentially the same as in Colossians 3:18, with the
addition of the ** <u>concept</u>**     * to your ** own**  husbands* .
 
 
    2) This is not a command for wives to submit to men in general, but rather
specifically and very exclusively to their    ** * <u>own</u>* ** *  husbands* .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Ephesians 5:33 – Paul further expanded on the command of submission to
include ** <u>respect</u>**  saying, “    * And the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.* ”
 
 
    1) Proverbs 12:4 says, “
    * 
        An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who shames [him]
        is like rottenness in his bones.
    * 
    ” A woman who disrespects her husband ** <u>shames</u>**  him.
    This should never be true of the believing wife.
 
 
    2) Proverbs 31:12 and 23 state, “
    * 
        She does him good and not evil all the days of her life …her husband is
        known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.
    * 
    ” When a believing wife respects her husband, he will be confident and hold
    his head ** <u>high</u>**  in everyday circumstances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Instead of being ** <u>fearful</u>**  and seeking to control
    her world, a believing wife would be wise to transfer her well-being to her
    husband and entrust herself to his care. This part of respecting her
    husband will bring peace to her own heart.
 
 
    c. In Ephesians 5:23a Paul went on to give an overarching principle for
    submission: * For the husband is the ** <u>head</u>**  * 
    (God-ordained authority)*  of the wife* .
 
 
    1) To be the ** <u>head</u>**  implies not only leadership but
    also accountability and responsibility, two things that most men are not
    naturally inclined to do well.
 
 
    2) For Eve back in the Garden of Eden, Adam was a colossal failure in
    leadership. If you are under a less than perfect, or even unspiritual, man,
this will be an ongoing challenge to your walk of    ** <u>faith</u>**  as a woman of God. God will give you grace as
    you trust in Him. Luke 1:45
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. In Ephesians 5:23 Paul added that the believing wife should subject
    herself to her own husband because God ordained the Christian marriage to
    be a ** <u>model</u>**  of Christ and His bride. The church’s
    subjection to Christ parallels the role of the Christian wife toward her
    husband.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    e. Ephesians 5:24 –
    * 
        But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be
        to their husbands in everything
    * 
    . The believing wife should be subject to her own husband in every way just
    as the ** <u>church</u>**  is called to be subject to her head,
    Jesus Christ, in all things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4. 1 Peter 3:1-6 – Peter also taught on the ** <u>role</u>**  of
    the Christian wife. Let’s consider his teaching.
 
 
    a. 1 Peter 3:1a –
    * 
        In the ** <u>same</u>**  way, you wives, be submissive…
    * 
    The phrase * in the same way*  refers back to Christ’s example of
    resolute perseverance in the midst of the difficulties of life and death. 1
    Peter 2:21-25
 
 
b. 1 Peter 3:1a – The instruction is: …    * wives, be submissive to your own husbands* .
 
 
    1) Peter and Paul had the ** <u>same</u>**  basic command for
    wives: Be submissive.
 
 
2) We will observe that Peter used a different rationale for    ** <u>why</u>**  the believing wife should be submissive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. 1 Peter 3:1b-2 – Let’s consider ** <u>Peter’s</u>**  reason
    for willing submission.
 
 
    1) 1 Peter 3:1b-2 –
    * 
        So that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be
        won without a word…
    * 
    Peter encouraged submission from believing wives because he concluded that
even a disobedient-to-the-Word husband could be    ** * <u>won</u>* **  over for God without the wife even
    opening her mouth.
 
 
    2) 1 Peter 3:2 –
    * 
        …by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and
        respectful behavior.
    * 
    The quiet manner of a wife speaks ** <u>volumes</u>** . Sadly
    some believing women speak through every way except through a quiet spirit.
 
 
    d. 1 Peter 3:3-4a – Speaking to wives Peter added, “
    * 
        Your adornment must not be merely external…but let it be the hidden
person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a        ** <u>gentle</u>**  and quiet spirit.
    * 
    ”
 
 
    1) Although Jesus was gentle, meek and lowly, He was in no way a pushover
    or ** <u>weak</u>** . Jesus was very sure of Himself and
    confident, yet He resigned Himself completely to do His Father’s will.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) Proverbs 31:30 states that c
    * 
        harm is deceitful and beauty is ** <u>vain</u>** , [but] a
        woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.
    * 
 
 
    a) When a ** <u>woman</u>**  allows outward appearance to
    dominate her, she has difficulty focusing on what truly matters.
 
 
    b) The women of the world operate under the illusion that maintaining
external beauty is central to happiness. The truth is that** <u>true</u>**  attractiveness comes from the internal beauty    * of a gentle and quite spirit* .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
3) The believing wife who walks according to God’s    ** <u>model</u>**  as seen in these verses will be a blessing to
    everyone, especially to her husband and children.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    e. 1 Peter 3:4b-6 – Relying on an Old Testament illustration, Peter
    continued his teaching on the ** quiet <u>power</u>**  of the
    submissive wife.
 
 
    1) 1 Peter 3:4b – God esteems as ** <u>priceless</u>**  a
    believing wife’s gentle and quiet spirit.
    * 
With the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit,        ** which is precious in the sight of God** .
    * 
 
 
    2) 1 Peter 3:5 – In the Old Testament, the matriarchs of the faith adorned
    themselves by willing subjection to their husbands.
    * 
        For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God,
        used to ** <u>adorn</u>**  themselves, being submissive to
        their own husbands;
        <br/>
        <br/>
    * 
 
 
    3) 1 Peter 3:6a – Sarah’s faith in God exceeded her fears and allowed her
to ** <u>submit</u>**  to Abraham.    *  Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.* 
 
 
    a) It is a ** <u>fearful</u>**  thing to submit to another human
    being, especially to a fellow sinner.
 
 
    b) ** <u>Sarah</u>**  was an amazing example of a woman who
    struggled with her faith, i.e., laughing at God’s promise, while in the
    same moment meekly honoring her very imperfect husband, Abraham, referring
    to him as, “* My lord* .” Genesis 18:12-15
 
 
    4) 1 Peter 3:6b – Just as Abraham is the father of all who believe God’s
    Word, Sarah is the mother of all wives who submit to their husbands without
    being vanquished by fear.
    * 
        And you have become her ** <u>children</u>**  if you do what
        is right without being frightened by any fear.
    * 
 
 
    a) Since this command to submit to your husband is God’s command, you can
    be sure that if by ** <u>faith</u>**  you obey God, He will
    indeed take care of you and your children. You need not fear. You will have
    God’s blessing. Psalm 56:11
 
 
    b) With that said, if a husband puts his wife into a harmful or sinful
    situation, the wife has the right to ** <u>obey</u>**  God over
    and above her husband. In such a situation she has the right to refuse to
    submit. Exodus 1:17; Daniel 6:13; Acts 4:19, 5:29
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:19 – Teaching for the believing husband (Eph. 5:25-33, 1
        Pet. 3:7)
    ** 
 
 
1. Colossians 3:19 – Paul gave two commands to the Christian    ** <u>husband</u>** .
 
 
a. Colossians 3:19a – Paul's first command was    ** <u>positive</u>** : * Husbands love your wives* .
 
 
1) The command for husbands to love their wives is clear and    ** <u>simple</u>** .
 
 
    2) Proverbs 30:21-23 makes a powerful statement:
    * 
        Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up: a
servant who becomes king, a fool who is full of food,        ** an <u>unloved</u> woman who is married** , and a
        maidservant who displaces her mistress.
    * 
 
 
    3) The biblical command to love one’s wife was extraordinary in a world
where wives were often considered property and marriage a thing of    ** <u>social</u>**  necessity, not love.
 
 
    4) Ever since the first century, ** <u>love</u>**  has been the
    Christian buzzword. Even today the command to love your wife easily becomes
    a cliché. Yet the command is not to be taken lightly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5) A believing husband cannot properly love without the enablement of the
    Spirit. You ** <u>cannot</u>**  love your wife by mere human
    determination. 2 Corinthians 3:5
 
 
    a) The word for love used here is AGAPAO. This is a Spirit-produced
    all-give-no-demand type of love. Galatians 5:22
 
 
b) Biblical love is a dynamic pursuit in which a husband actively    ** <u>trusts</u>**  the Lord to love his wife through Him.
    Colossians 1:8, Romans 15:30
 
 
    b. Colossians 3:19b – Paul's ** <u>second</u>**  command was
negative in nature, addressing a grave problem in many men:    * Husbands* …* do not be embittered against them* .
 
 
    1) Simply put, the Christian husband must ** <u>never</u>** 
    treat his wife unkindly.
 
 
2) The word translated * embittered*  PIKRAINO speaks of bitterness,    ** <u>anger</u>** , exasperation or irritability.
 
 
    a) Interestingly, this command is in the passive voice indicating that you
    are never to allow passive aggression to ** <u>surge</u>**  up
    within you and spill over toward your wife.
 
 
b) The command being in the passive voice speaks against    ** <u>innate</u>**  bitterness. Some husbands will argue that a
    down-in-the-mouth attitude is just the way they are and they cannot help
    it. A husband’s bitter attitude should never be projected onto his wife.
 
 
3) This command must not be downplayed. Bitterness is a severe scourge in    ** <u>many</u>**  Christian marriage relationships.
 
 
    a) Sadly, this type of treatment of a wife destroys the very longings a
    husband has to have a supportive wife. A wife cannot be supportive under
    such ** <u>duress</u>** .
 
 
    b) Harsh or vindictive treatment feeds a wife’s insecurities concerning her
    husband’s ** <u>love</u>**  and acceptance of her.
 
 
4) Paul gave no exceptions to this command. He gave a clear directive    ** <u>against</u>**  being bitter toward your wife, no
    exceptions. There is never any good reason for the Christian husband to be
    hostile or harsh toward his wife.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Ephesians 5:25-33 – In the parallel passage of Ephesians 5 Paul not only
gave the command for husbands to love their wives, but also added    ** <u>two</u>**  supporting principles on how to do so.
 
 
a. The need for a believing husband to love his wife is repeated    ** <u>three</u>**  times in nine verses. It is interesting that
    the command is repeated three times. Could it be that men have a problem
    with this duty?
 
 
1) Ephesians 5:25 –    * Husbands, ** <u>love</u> your wives** * …
 
 
    2) Ephesians 5:28 –
    * 
        Husbands ought also to ** <u>love</u> their own wives**  as
        their own bodies
    * 
    …
 
 
    3) Ephesians 5:33 –
    * 
Each individual among you also is to        ** <u>love</u> his own wife**  even as himself
    * 
    …
 
 
    b. Ephesians 5:25-27 – The ** first**  supporting principle Paul
gave in this passage for how a husband is to love his wife is …    * just as Christ loved the ** <u>church</u>** * .
 
 
1) Ephesians 5:25a –    * Just as Christ loved the ** <u>church</u>** …*  Christ
    loves the church based on grace, therefore His love for the church is
    unconditional and eternal.
 
 
    a) Christ incessantly intercedes on ** <u>behalf</u>**  of His
    church. John 17:20-26, Romans 8:34, Hebrews 7:25
 
 
    b) Christ straightforwardly ** <u>reveals</u>**  Himself and His
    plan to the church. 1 Corinthians 2:6-10, Ephesians 3:3-5, Colossians
    1:26-27
 
 
    c) Christ provides rest and ** <u>shares</u>**  the burden of
    life with each of us individually in the church. Matthew 11:28-30
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2) Ephesians 5:25b – * Just as Christ* …    * gave himself up for her* . Christ’s love for the church is a
    completely ** <u>self</u>** -sacrificing love. Christ gave His
    life for her.
 
 
    a) Just as faith manifests itself through visible works, so also love is
    seen through ** <u>actions</u>** . The way to communicate love
    to your wife is through tangible sacrifices for her benefit. John 3:16
 
 
    b) In order for a Christian husband to give himself up for his wife just as
    Christ gave Himself up for the ** <u>church</u>** , his love
    must come from divine origin not from feeble human effort.
 
 
    c) The type of love a wife needs ** <u>comes</u>**  from a
    husband who lives by grace and dependence on the Lord.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Ephesians 5:26 – What is Christ’s purpose in unconditionally loving His
    church?
    * 
        So that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of
        water with the ** <u>word</u>** 
    * 
    .
 
 
    a) Just as Christ sanctifies and cleanses His church, Christian husbands
    ought to ** <u>take</u>**  responsibility for the spiritual
    well-being of their wives (and families).
 
 
    b) A believing husband should be ** <u>filled</u>**  with the
    Word himself because only then will he be able to properly communicate it
    to his wife and children.
 
 
    4) Ephesians 5:27 – What is Christ’s ultimate goal in his love for the
    Church?
    * 
That He might present to Himself the church in all her        ** <u>glory</u>** , having no spot or wrinkle or any such
        thing, but that she would be holy and blameless.
    * 
 
 
    a) A Christian husband should ** <u>teach</u>**  his household
    with the goal of seeing his wife and family live holy and blameless lives.
 
 
b) This kind of goal requires investment and the same selfless    ** <u>love</u>**  that Christ demonstrates towards His church in
    sacrificing and continually working for her good.
 
 
    c) It is easy for a husband to think ** <u>only</u>**  of
    himself and of his personal success in life. God calls the believing
    husband to go beyond and be nurturing in his love for his wife as Christ is
    for His church.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Ephesians 5:28-33 – The ** second**  supporting principle
Paul gave for how husbands are to love their wives is    ** * as their own <u>bodies</u>* ** .
 
 
    1) Ephesians 5:28 – We know that one of the top priorities of every human
    is to take ** <u>care</u>**  of his or her own body.
    * 
        So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He
        who loves his own wife loves himself
    * 
    .
 
 
    a) God’s command to you as a believing husband is for you to provide for
and protect your wife as spontaneously and with as much    ** <u>urgency</u>**  as you take care of yourself.
 
 
    b) This level of love is impossible ** <u>apart</u>**  from
    divine enablement, so look to God in faith for this kind of love. Loving in
    this way is sure to make an incredible impact on your wife. Romans 2:4,
    Ephesians 2:7
 
 
    2) Ephesians 5:29 – We know that Christ loves the church deeply
    and even now lives for her good.
    * 
        For no one ever ** <u>hated</u>**  his own flesh, but
        nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church.
    * 
    John 13:34, Ephesians 5:2
 
 
    a) When you are hungry, you get something to ** <u>eat</u>** .
    When you are thirsty, you get something to drink. When you are tired, you
    go to bed and get some sleep.
 
 
    b) When you are upset, you turn to things that provide you comfort. When
    your life is threatened, you protect yourself at all costs. That’s the
    natural human ** <u>way</u>**  of being and that’s how believing
    men are to care for their wives.
 
 
3) Ephesians 5:30 – Christ loves us individually …    * because we are members of His ** <u>body</u>** * .
 
 
a) Just like a person nourishes and cherishes his    ** <u>own</u>**  body, Christ nourishes and cherishes us because
    we are members who make up his body.
 
 
    b) In the next three verses, the apostle Paul explained how this concept
applies to a Christian marriage and a husband’s responsibility to    ** <u>love</u>**  his wife as he loves himself.
 
 
    4) Ephesians 5:31 – Paul quoted the key verse in the Bible that initially
    established the institution of marriage.
    * 
        For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be
joined to his wife, and        ** the two shall become one <u>flesh</u>** 
    * 
    . Genesis 2:24
 
 
    5) Ephesians 5:32 – The mystery of two different people melding together to
    form ** <u>one</u>**  body through marriage is a great mystery.
    * 
        This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and
        the church.
    * 
 
 
    6) Ephesians 5:33 – Although it is a great mystery, the fact that a husband
    and wife are one flesh is the reason a husband should love his wife to the
    same degree he loves himself.
    * 
Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his        ** <u>own</u>**  wife even as himself
    * 
    .
 
 
    a) Rather than seeing his wife as a separate ** <u>entity</u>** 
    , a husband needs to clearly understand that he and his wife are one.
    Whatever he does toward her is ultimately done toward himself.
 
 
b) For this reason he should love his wife as    ** <u>himself</u>** , because after all, the two of them in
    God’s eyes are one and the same.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3. 1 Peter 3:7 – Peter ** <u>also</u>**  taught on the
    responsibilities of the Christian husband.
 
 
    a. 1 Peter 3:7a – Peter's first ** <u>counsel</u>**  was that
    husbands should*  …live with [their] wives in an understanding way* .
 
 
    1) Peter did not say you must fully understand your wife. He said to live
    with your wife in an understanding ** <u>way</u>** . How should
    a husband live with his wife? What kind of understanding should a husband
    have?
 
 
a) Husbands need to appreciate the fact that by God’s    ** <u>design</u>**  women do not think the same as men. That of
    course is a very good thing in marriage. Our world would be very one
    dimensional without the female perspective. Every husband needs his wife’s
    point of view.
 
 
b) Although a husband should actively study his wife by engaged    ** <u>listening</u>** , he will never fully understand all her
    perspectives. At the same time, a believing wife’s insights are very much
    needed by her husband.
 
 
    c) If a believing husband knows his wife’s mood swings, worries, triggers,
    needs, likes and dislikes, he can become a huge blessing to her. Instead of
    reacting negatively, he can ** <u>learn</u>**  to act in
    proactive love.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) In summary, listen carefully because you ** <u>want</u>**  to
    understand and get to know your wife. As you do, you will know what she
    likes and doesn’t like and be able to cherish her in a way that is
    meaningful and speaks love to her.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. 1 Peter 3:7b – Some people have misunderstood Peter’s next advice to
    husbands. ** * <u>Live</u>* ** 
    * 
with your wives in an understanding way,        ** as with someone weaker, since she is a woman** 
    * 
    . Let’s interpret this statement.
 
 
1) The intent of Peter in this statement is not some    ** <u>macho</u>**  man concept that women are inferior to men.
 
 
    2) Peter is not saying that the wife is a ** <u>vessel</u>**  of
    disgrace to be disregarded. Quite the contrary.
 
 
    3) Peter’s statement implies that just as with a valuable vessel, you ought
    to give greater attention to the way you ** <u>treat</u>**  her.
    When the words “fragile” are written across a package, it does not mean the
    package is less valuable, in fact it more often means quite the contrary.
 
 
4) When a husband believes his wife is of great    ** <u>value</u>** , he will treat her accordingly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. 1 Peter 3:7c – Peter concludes his teaching to husbands saying, “    ** * Show her honor* ** 
    * 
        as a fellow ** <u>heir</u>**  of the grace of life, so that
        your prayers will not be hindered.
    * 
    ”
 
 
    1) * Show her ** <u>honor</u>** …*  reiterates our
    interpretation of the fact that Peter was not teaching some Christian form
    of chauvinism. The wife is to be honored by the believing husband. Among
    religions, only biblical Christianity provides dignified respect for wives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) * As a ** fellow <u>heir</u>**  of the grace of life…* 
    A believing wife is a fellow heiress of God’s grace.
 
 
a) In God’s economy of grace, male and female are    ** <u>equal</u>** . The ground at the foot of the cross is
    level.
    * 
        There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for
        you are all one in Christ Jesus.
    * 
    Galatians 3:28
 
 
    b) There is ** <u>unity</u>**  when a husband honors his wife by
    loving her as he loves himself and a wife respects her husband and submits
    to his love and leading.
 
 
    c) In this way husbands and wives function as one unit as they raise their
    families and serve the ** <u>Lord</u>** .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) * So that [their] prayers may not be ** hindered** …* 
Peter’s directive to the Christian husband to treat his wife as    * a fellow heir of the ** <u>grace</u>**  of life… * was
    very pragmatic, so that they could have an effective and unencumbered
    prayer life.
 
 
    a) Your wife is a ** <u>fellow</u>**  member of the body of
    Christ. She is God’s child just as you are, therefore she has equal access
    to the throne of grace in believing prayer. John 13:34, 35
 
 
b) Sadly, when a believing husband does not give proper    ** <u>honor</u>**  to the wife, their fellowship with God and
    each other gets hurt and their prayers go unanswered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** C. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:20 – Teachings for believing children (Eph. 6:1-3)
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 3:20 – * Children, be obedient to your parents…*  To
    believing children Paul gave ** <u>one</u>**  small command with
    huge implications. Proverbs 6:20
 
 
a. Colossians 3:20a – * Children, be obedient… * The word    * obedient*  HUPAKOUO is a compound word made up of HUPO meaning under
    and AKOUO meaning to ** <u>hear</u>**  or listen.
 
 
1) In a literal sense, * obey*  HUPAKOUO means to    ** <u>listen</u>**  with submission or to hear in subjection.
 
 
2) By implication, this command means Christian children are to    ** <u>heed</u>**  their parents’ commands as being under their
    authority.
 
 
3) The command to obey is ** <u>straightforward</u>** . The verb    * obey*  is in the present tense, active voice and imperative mood.
 
 
a) The present tense means that as a believing child you should obey    ** <u>right</u>**  away, not wait till you feel like it. As the
    saying goes, “Delayed obedience is disobedience.”
 
 
    b) The active ** <u>voice</u>**  means that the obedience is to
    be a proactive response.
 
 
c) Lastly the imperative mood makes * obey*  a    ** <u>direct</u>**  command from God, commanding the Christian
    child to positively comply.
 
 
b. Colossians 3:20 –    * Children, be obedient ** to your parents** * . Notice the
    plural word * parents*  here. The command is for the believing child
    to be obedient to ** <u>both</u>**  parents. Obviously broken
    homes make this difficult, but the spirit of this verse can be honored as
    the believing child trusts God.
 
 
    c. Colossians 3:20 –
    * 
Children, be obedient to your parents        ** in <u>all</u> things** …
    * 
 
 
    1) Children are to obey their parents in ** <u>every</u>**  way.
 
 
    a) When a child is told to study, clean up, brush teeth, wash dishes, or
anything else around the house, it is his or her job to obey    ** <u>right</u>**  away.
 
 
    b) Obedience in all things is the biblical ** <u>duty</u>**  of
    every believing child.
 
 
    2) At this point there is usually a question about unconditional obedience.
What if your parents ask you to do something that is clearly    ** <u>wrong</u>** ? What is the Christian young person to do in
    such a situation?”
 
 
    a) If your parents ask you to steal, lie, or ** <u>break</u>** 
    one of God’s commands, you are to obey God rather than your parents. This
    would clearly be the exception not the rule. Acts 5:29
 
 
b) For a parent to ask a child to sin is rare, but it    ** <u>might</u>**  happen. In such cases you, as a believer in
    Christ, would obey God’s Word above the command of your parents, even if
    you were punished for it. As you honor the Lord, He will help you in
    difficult situations. (Study Daniel 3)
 
 
    d. Colossians 3:20 –
    * 
Children, be obedient to your parents in all things,        ** for this is well-pleasing to the <u>Lord</u>** .
    * 
 
 
    1) The word * well-pleasing*  EUARESTOS means fully agreeable. This
    means that God ** <u>loves</u>**  it when Christian children
    obey their moms and dads.
 
 
2) Young believer, God wants you to obey this command by    ** <u>faith</u>**  not feelings. It is His command to you and
    there is eternal value for you as you obey. You need to trust that whatever
    God commands you to do is best and good for you, and most of all it is
    pleasing to God.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3) Positive responses to God’s mandate will not only benefit you in the
    short term but will also set your life on a ** <u>path</u>**  of
    positive growth. Deuteronomy 5:16, Proverbs 6:20-23
 
 
4) Submission to authority is one of the most important things you can    ** <u>learn</u>** . It will not only bless you personally but
    will also help you in the future in your community, job, church, ministry,
    marriage and family. Proverbs 3:21-23, Exodus 20:12
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Ephesians 6:1-3 – Let’s consider another passage in the New Testament
    concerning Christian ** <u>children</u>** .
 
 
    a. Ephesians 6:1 – Paul essentially gave the ** <u>same</u>** 
command to the Ephesian children as to the Colossians when he said, “    * Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.* ”
 
 
    1) Ephesians 6:1a – * Children obey… * Here we hear the same basic
    command to ** <u>obey</u>**  your parents restated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2) Ephesians 6:1b – Paul added the phrase, “    * In the ** <u>Lord</u>** * ,” to his command. This phrase
    sometimes creates questions.
 
 
    a) This does not mean that you are to obey your parents only if they are
    Christians, as some have concluded. The command to obey has nothing to do
    with whether or not your ** <u>parents</u>**  are believers. You
    must obey them regardless of their spiritual state.
 
 
    b) So what does * in the Lord*  mean? * In the Lord*  and as a
believer are synonymous statements. * In the Lord*  means because you    ** <u>belong</u>**  to God.
 
 
    c) Of course all children ought to obey their parents, but Paul and the
    apostles never sought to ** <u>correct</u>**  the unsaved
multitudes. Their focus was always specifically on those who are    * in the Lord* , speaking specifically of believers.
 
 
3) Ephesians 6:1c – We have the phrase …    * for this is ** <u>right</u>** * .
 
 
a) Simply put, this means that this is your Christian    ** <u>duty</u>** , or the right thing to do. God’s will for the
    young believer is obedience to parents.
 
 
    b) While the command to obey is for ** <u>minors</u>** , the
    directive to honor your parents remains constant for life. Exodus 20:12
 
 
    c) Once you get married, your loyalty is to change from your parents to
    your spouse. Implicitly the command to obey ends there, however as
    believers we should never ** <u>stop</u>**  honoring our
    parents. Genesis 2:24
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Ephesians 6:2 – Paul reiterated his command to Christian children by
    quoting from the Ten Commandments. ** * <u>Honor</u>* ** 
    * 
        your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise
    * 
    .
 
 
    1) Unlike the command to obey, this command to honor our parents must be
    remembered until ** <u>death</u>** .
 
 
    2) It is interesting that the apostle did not tell children to honor their
    parents if they ** <u>deserve</u>**  it. All believers are to
    honor their parents because that is God’s will for them.
 
 
    c. Ephesians 6:3 – The command to honor our parents comes with a blessed
    promise:
    * 
So that it may be well with you, and that you may        ** <u>live</u>**  long on the earth.
    * 
 
 
    1) In the wisdom of God, He not only gave children the commands to obey and
to honor their parents, but above and beyond, he gave    ** <u>two</u>**  enormous incentives for faithful compliance.
 
 
    a) First, he promised that life would go ** <u>well</u>**  for
    the child who honored his or her parents.
 
 
b) Second, that child would go on to live a long    ** <u>life</u>**  on the earth. Proverbs 3:1-2, 4:10
 
 
2) We probably all know of individuals who honored their parents but    ** <u>died</u>**  young. Conversely we probably also know of
    some people who were dishonoring to their parents and lived to be very old.
    Why?
 
 
a) Simply put, situations like these are exceptions, not the    ** <u>general</u>**  rule. The general principle remains that
    those who honor their parents have long prosperous lives while rebellion
    shortens a life.
 
 
    b) Proverbs 3:1-2 –
    * 
My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart        ** <u>keep</u>**  my commandments; for length of days and
        years of life and peace they will add to you.
    * 
 
 
    c) Your decision by faith to honor your parents will set you on a path to
    blessing in ** <u>life</u>** . Proverbs 12:28
 
 
    3) Conclusion: Children are not ** <u>able</u>**  to obey this
    command consistently and with a proper attitude by human determination
    alone.
 
 
    a) Believing children do well to trust the Lord for the strength to obey
and honor their parents. Without God’s enabling    ** <u>grace</u>**  even the simplest commands are impossible.
    John 15:4-5
 
 
b) Young people, in your relationship with your parents you need to    ** <u>trust</u>**  God to give you the desire and the power to
    honor and obey with a good attitude. Philippians 2:12-13
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** D. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:21 – Teaching for believing parents (Eph. 6:4)
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 3:21 –
    * 
Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not        ** <u>lose</u>**  heart
    * 
    . Paul commanded parents not to create ** discouragement**  in
    their children.
 
 
    a. Colossians 3:21a – ** * <u>Fathers</u>* **  (plural) can
    legitimately be translated either dads or parents. In Hebrews 11:23 the
    same Greek word is translated * parents* .
 
 
1) From the context here in Colossians, it appears God is speaking to    ** <u>parents</u>** , both moms and dads, and not to dads (men)
    only.
 
 
    2) In Greek, the ** <u>first</u>**  word in a sentence often
    receives the emphasis. Paul wanted to get the attention of parents on this
    matter. Parents listen up and pay attention.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Colossians 3:21b –* Do not exasperate your ** <u>children</u>** * .    * Exasperate*  ERETHIZO is a present tense command coupled with the
    negation ME and means to stop provoking right away. The use of the present
    tense command leads us to the conclusion that provocation by parents was
    probably a current ongoing issue.
 
 
1) The word * exasperate*  ERETHIZO literally means to arouse,    ** <u>incite</u>** , challenge, kindle, or to make passionate.
    It can be either positive (2 Cor. 9:2) or negative. Colossians 3:21
 
 
    2) Here * exasperate*  ERETHIZO connotes the idea of passion by a
    direct challenge. For a ** <u>parent</u>**  to deliberately
    impassion a son or daughter is an affront to this command.
 
 
3) The following examples are all possible translations of the word* exasperate*  used in the negative sense; be    ** <u>hard</u>**  on, embitter, hassle, harass, irritate, make
    resentful, nag, pick at, pick on, poke fun at, provoke, ride, or vex, to
    name just a few.
 
 
    4) Parent, you can so easily ** <u>wound</u>**  your child
    without realizing it by constant nagging or pressure. Even in an effort to
    do what is right, you could cause your child to have a broken spirit or
    even give up on life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Colossians 3:21c – Why not nag or ride our children in our parenting
    style? So * that they may not ** <u>lose</u>**  heart* .
 
 
    1) * Lose heart*  ATHUMOS comes from A negation and THUMOS fierceness
    or ** <u>passion</u>** . Through provocation, parents can
    literally take the fire (life) right out of their children.
 
 
    a) A parent can unwittingly ** <u>cause</u>**  depression and a
    desire to give up in a child by burdensome provocations to be better,
    cooler, more athletic, more academic, or by comparisons with siblings,
    downing him or her in public, unrealistic goals or just by simply not
    listening.
 
 
b) If your child is constantly discouraged, this could be a    ** <u>sign</u>**  that you have a major flaw in your parenting.
    As a parent ask yourself if you are putting excessive pressure on your
    child causing dejection and despondency?
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) To summarize, parents are to be careful not to provoke their children,
sending them down the dark slippery slope of    ** <u>despair</u>** . Psalm 6
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Ephesians 6:4 – Let’s consider Paul’s additional teaching on parenting
from the book of Ephesians. Don’t be the ** <u>cause</u>**  of    ** rebellion**  in your child.
 
 
    a. Ephesians 6:4a – * And, fathers * PATER … Like the
instruction on parenting in Colossians, this command is for both    ** <u>parents</u>**  equally.
 
 
b. Ephesians 6:4b –    * Do not provoke your children to ** <u>wrath</u>** * .
    Similar to the command from Colossians 3:21 to not awaken passion in your
    child, this command is against spurring your child on towards resentful
    anger (rebellion).
 
 
    1) The command is in the present tense, emphasizing that this was likely a
    persistent ** <u>problem</u>**  in the church back then just as
    it is in ours today.
 
 
    2) Parents are told not to be the cause of anger in the life of their
children. The fact that God gave this command is proof enough that parents    ** <u>easily</u>**  do this kind of thing.
 
 
    3) In Ephesians, rather than causing our children to lose heart, we are
    told not to provoke ** <u>our</u>**  children to anger or
    rebellion. The extremes of ** implosion**  from discouragement
    (Col. 3:21) or ** explosion**  from angry rebellion (Eph. 6:4)
    can both be possible results of errors in parenting.
 
 
    4) The word PARORGIZETE translated * provoke to wrath*  holds the
    connotation of irritating someone to the ** <u>point</u>**  of
    anger, or inciting to anger.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. In summary, we see that parents are to be very careful not to cause
    rebellion. By excessive pressure, hassling, harassing or nagging you can
provoke your child to either despair or rebellion. So what    ** <u>are</u>**  you to do?
 
 
    3. Ephesians 6:4 – Be the guiding influence in your child’s world. How?
 
 
a. Ephesians 6:4c –    * But bring them ** <u>up</u>** * . Parents are challenged
    to rear their children with purpose.
 
 
1) First recognize it is ** your**  job as a parent to    ** <u>raise</u>**  your child. Principally that job does not
    belong to the village, the school or the church. You are responsible before
    God for your child’s rearing.
 
 
    2) The word for * bring up*  EKTREPHO means to nourish. It actually
    comes from a word that means fatten, ** <u>nurse</u>** , support
    or feed. To * bring up*  or * nourish*  is a primal concept
    inherent in love. 1 Thessalonians 2:7-8
 
 
    3) In Ephesians 5:29 * nourish*  EKTREPHO is used to describe the
    devoutness of men in ** <u>caring</u>**  for and protecting
    their own bodies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
b. Ephesians 6:4d – * But ** <u>bring</u>**  them up*     ** * in the discipline* ** * …* 
 
 
1) The word * discipline*  PAIDEIA means    ** <u>training</u>** , especially as it relates to children.
    Hebrews 12:5, 7, 11
 
 
    2) In ** <u>Greek</u>**  culture a PAIDAGOGOS was a childhood
    tutor who was responsible for the education and rearing of the children of
    the wealthy. Galatians 3:24-25
 
 
    3) Here in the book of Ephesians, Paul cut directly across the grain of the
    culture of the day by putting the responsibility of child-training directly
    on Christian ** <u>parents</u>**  rather than on tutors.
 
 
    4) Christian parents are to be the tutors and trainers PAIDAGOGOS to give
    correction to their ** <u>own</u>**  children. Deuteronomy 8:5;
    Proverbs 19:18, 29:17; Hebrews 12:7
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Ephesians 6:4e –
    * 
        But bring them up in the discipline ** and instruction** 
    * 
    …
 
 
    1) The word * instruction*  NOUTHESIA literally means to place
    instruction into the ** <u>mind</u>** . NUOS means mind and
    TITHEMI means to put or to place.
 
 
2) * Instruction*  is typically the positive or informative    ** <u>side</u>**  of training whereas * discipline* 
    carries negative or corrective overtones. Instruction is more proactive
    whereas discipline is more reactive.
 
 
    3) You are to ** <u>walk</u>**  alongside your children and
    disciple them in a step-by-step manner. You are not just to tell them what
    to do. You are to show them how to live by your own example and through
    thoughtful explanations. 2 Timothy 2:24-25
 
 
    4) Yelling at your children or getting ** <u>upset</u>**  with
    them when they make mistakes is called provoking, the very thing Paul
    prohibited. That is not the way to train your children.
 
 
5) You are to teach your children what the Word of God says and carefully    ** <u>explain</u>**  it to them in a way they can understand.
    Explain to them why you do what you do and why you believe what you
    believe. This is what is being communicated here. 1 Thessalonians 2:10-12
 
 
    6) Many parents today have bought into the secular thought that you are to
    only give your kids entertainment. Therefore they do not encourage them in
the things of the Lord unless they can do it in a fun way. This is    ** <u>wrong</u>**  thinking.
 
 
    d. Ephesians 6:4f –
    * 
But bring them up in the discipline and instruction        ** of the <u>Lord</u>** .
    * 
 
 
    1) Don’t lose the focus of Paul’s instruction here. Paul’s focus was not on
the child but on the parent. He was teaching parents how to    ** <u>raise</u>**  children.
 
 
    a) Paul called parents to have their ** <u>focus</u>**  on the
    Lord. Deuteronomy 6:7
 
 
b) You will only be successful as a parent to the degree you walk by    ** <u>means</u>**  of the wisdom of God’s Word and the power of
    God’s Spirit. Romans 12:2, Philippians 1:9, Colossians 1:9-10
 
 
    2) In wrap-up, our job as parents is to not discourage nor provoke our
    kids. We are to positively raise them in the ** <u>ways</u>** 
    of the Lord Jesus Christ in godly discipline and instruction. Genesis
    18:19, Psalm 78:4
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** E. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 3:22-25 – Teaching for believing employees (Eph. 6:5-8)
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 3:22a – * Slaves* … The word * slave*  DOULOS is
    the word for bondman or ** <u>servant</u>** .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
a. In Bible times, if you were a slave, you were either a slave by    ** <u>choice</u>**  or a slave by force. This term applied to
    both groups. The average day laborer in those days was a slave.
 
 
1) In the Roman Empire, during the first century, nearly one in    ** <u>five</u>**  people (approximately 12 million souls) were
    said to have been slaves.
 
 
2) As you might imagine, the Roman economy depended heavily on this    ** <u>pool</u>**  of forced-laborers.
 
 
    3) Slaves were both ** <u>skilled</u>**  and unskilled. It was
    not unusual for slaves to be lawyers, doctors, teachers, and other
    important professions, jobs that today would be considered far above the
    pay grade of slave labor.
 
 
b. Even though legalized slavery is generally a thing of the** <u>past</u>** , these biblical principles readily apply to    ** Christian employees**  today. Since slaves constituted the
    work force of the ancient world, to apply this passage to our work force
    today is not a biblical stretch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
2. Colossians 3:22b – * Obey*  is the standard    ** <u>word</u>**  we find in this passage for slaves, and for
    our application, Christian employees. The believing employee’s mission is
    to * obey [his or her] master.* 
 
 
    a. The word * obey*  HUPAKOUO means HUPO under and AKOUO hear.
    Biblical obedience means ** <u>listen</u>**  as a subordinate.
 
 
    b. In Colossians 3:20 this ** <u>same</u>**  word is used for
    children when they are commanded to obey their parents.
 
 
c. This is a present, active, imperative command emphasizing the    ** <u>need</u>**  for believers to continually obey their
    earthly masters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    3. Colossians 3:22c – Who is the employee to obey?
 
 
    a.
    * 
        Obey**  <u>your</u>**  ** masters**  on earth
    * 
    … The believing slave needed to obey his or her earthly master. Today we
    would encourage believing employees to faithfully comply with the
    instructions of their secular employers.
 
 
    b. * Obey your masters ** on <u>earth</u>** * … The Holy
    Spirit probably added this to forbid Christian slaves from
    self-emancipating based on the teaching that they had no master but God. 1
    Corinthians 7:20-24
 
 
    4. Colossians 3:22d-23 – We can discern ** <u>seven</u>** 
    directives for slaves in this passage, and by way of application these
    should be a part of every Christian’s work ethic.
 
 
a. Colossians 3:22d – Be dependable:    * Obey… in ** <u>all</u>**  things* … A Christian worker
    should obey always and in all ways. As we work, we are to willingly
    complete whatever tasks we are given, unless in doing so we would be
    breaking one of God’s laws.
 
 
    b. Colossians 3:22e – Be diligent: * Obey… not with external service* 
    … We are not to merely give an external ** <u>show</u>** . God
    wants us to work diligently from a good attitude.
 
 
c. Colossians 3:22f – Be faithful:* Obey…not as those who merely please men* … We are not to    ** <u>just</u>**  perform as people-pleasers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
d. Colossians 3:22g – Be honest:    * Obey… with sincerity of ** <u>heart</u>** * … The word
    translated * sincerity*  means uncomplicated. This directive counters
    duplicity of heart and communicates the need for honesty and integrity on
    the job.
 
 
e. Colossians 3:22h – Be reverent:    * Obey… ** <u>fearing</u>**  the Lord* … We are to obey
    based on a reverent fear of God. One day soon we are going to answer to
    God, not man, about how we lived our secular lives.
 
 
f. Colossians 3:23a – Be enthusiastic:    * Obey… ** <u>heartily</u>** …*  Whatever your task, work
    at it enthusiastically from the heart. * Heartily*  has the thought of
    working both cheerfully and hard at the same time.
 
 
g. Colossians 3:23b – Be principled:    * Obey… as for the ** <u>Lord</u>**  and not for men.*  In
    reality, as a believer, no matter what you do, you should be doing your
    responsibilities to please and honor God not people.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5. Colossians 3:24-25 – Paul finished with a threefold motivation for
    slaves (employees) to be ** <u>faithful</u>**  in their
    obedience to their secular masters (employers).
 
 
    a. Colossians 3:24a – Employees should give faithful obedience based on
    knowledge of their ** <u>future</u>** .
    * 
        Obey knowing that from the Lord you ** will receive**  the
        reward of the inheritance
    * 
    .
 
 
    1) Obey because you ** <u>know</u>** , with all certainty, that
    whether or not you are rewarded here, God, your real Master, has already
    promised you an inheritance in heaven. This is not an “if” statement, it is
    a promise.
 
 
    2) The irony of this statement is that no ** <u>slave</u>** 
    received any inheritance in Roman life. This would have been an almost
    unbelievable statement to a slave in that day, but when embraced, it would
    have dramatically changed his or her perspective on present sufferings and
    on future glory. Hebrew 6:12
 
 
    3) Even though Paul spoke this truth directly to believing slaves, we can
    all ** <u>claim</u>**  this promise. All believers will receive
    from the Lord the reward of the inheritance. This is a positional truth
    with the promise of future glorification given as a ** fact** .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 3:24b – Employees should give faithful obedience based on
knowing whom they are really serving. * Obey * …* knowing* …    * it is the Lord Christ whom you serve* … It is always so important to
    understand that even in the secular realm we ultimately serve Christ and
    not ** <u>man</u>** .
 
 
    1) Notice that Paul encouraged slaves to look ** <u>past</u>** 
    their earthly masters to the Lord Christ. This adjustment in focus would
    ensure proper motivation in day-to-day labor.
 
 
    2) The name for Jesus given here is * LORD CHRIST* . This is the only
    place this title for Jesus appears in the Bible and it is significant
    because a slave could fully identify with that phrase. As believers, slaves
    had a ** <u>new</u>**  master. The * Lord Christ*  was
    their true master now that they were believers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    c. Colossians 3:25 – Employees should give faithful obedience based on
    knowledge of the immediate consequences. * Obey …* knowing…
    * 
        he who does ** <u>wrong</u>**  will receive the consequences
        of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.
    * 
 
 
    1) Colossians 3:25a –
    * 
        He who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he
        has done…
    * 
Notice Paul did not say that a slave would receive consequences    ** from the <u>Lord</u>** . That is not what this is saying.
 
 
    a) We know that bad conduct on the part of the slave (employee) did not go
    without disciplinary ** <u>action</u>**  in that day and age.
    The book of Philemon is a great example of this fact.
 
 
    b) Paul reminded slaves of their ** <u>present</u>**  reality,
    which in many ways holds true of employees today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2) Colossians 3:25b – * And that without partiality. * Paul gave a
    very pragmatic reason to be faithful in service. Just as a slave master
    would not let a slave off the ** <u>hook</u>**  for being
    unfaithful just because he was a Christian, your employer is not likely let
    you off the hook just because you are a believer.
 
 
    a) At work, believers as well as unbelievers will receive the consequences
    they deserve for ** <u>bad</u>**  performance.
 
 
    b) Obviously this does not take away from the ** <u>truth</u>** 
    of reward or loss of reward at the Judgment Seat of Christ for negligence
    in time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** F. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 4:1 – Teachings for believing employers (Eph. 6:9)
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 4:1a – ** <u>Masters</u>**  KURIOS were slave
    owners. Although slave owners are essentially outlawed in the world today,
    this teaching clearly applies to business owners, employers and bosses who
    are over today’s workforce.
 
 
    a. Originally * master*  or * lord*  KURIOS was the word used to
    describe the ** <u>gods</u>**  of the Greek pantheon. In the New
Testament the word * master*  KURIOS is typically translated    * Lord*  when speaking of God, or*  master*  when speaking of
    humans. Matthew 24:28
 
 
    b. Unlike English where * master*  means one who is sovereign, or the
    person of uncontested power and ownership, in the New Testament when KURIOS
    is used of humans it means the person with ** <u>legal</u>** 
    authority over his property and slave workforce.
 
 
    c. In this passage, the word is specifically used for slave owners, but the
    principles ** <u>apply</u>**  just as well to employers or
    bosses in our day.
 
 
    2. Colossians 4:1b – * Grant to your slaves justice and fairness* …
    The mandate for employers is to * grant*  ** <u>two</u>** 
    fundamental rights.
 
 
a. Colossians 4:1b –* Masters**  grant**  to your slaves…*  The word    ** * <u>grant</u>* **  PARECHO is a present tense command
    that means to furnish, present, afford or exhibit. This word stressed the
    ongoing need of masters to provide for their workers.
 
 
1) Clearly the master had the power to either provide or withhold    ** <u>good</u>**  from his subordinates.
 
 
2) By way of application, God would have Christian employers grant (    ** <u>offer</u>**  or afford) their employees two rights.
 
 
b. Colossians 4:1c –    * Masters grant… ** <u>justice</u>** …*  Paul instructed
    believing masters to give justice to their workers.
 
 
    1) Justice DIKAIOS comes from the word DIKE meaning correct in the
fulfillment of ** <u>duties</u>** . In the New Testament    * justice*  came to mean correctness that accords with God’s standards
    or requirements, not merely with the requirements of society.
 
 
    2) Paul commanded that believing masters ** <u>treat</u>** 
    their workers by God’s standards, not human standards. They were to be
    objective and unbiased in their dealings with their workforce.
 
 
    3) This would have been a radical change of thinking for Christian masters
in Paul’s day. It should also affect how Christian employers treat their    ** <u>workers</u>** .
 
 
    4) Because of a tendency the world over to be inequitable, government
    agencies have been formed to regulate industry and enforce justice for
employees. In light of Paul’s command here, a    ** <u>believing</u>**  employer should readily go above and
    beyond the requirements of government.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 4:1d –* Masters grant… ** <u>fairness</u>** …*  The word    * fairness*  ISOTES literally means likeness in proportions. By
    implication * fairness*  means impartiality or equality.
 
 
1) As believers we should realize that nationality,    ** <u>race</u>** , ethnicity, or any other supposed distinction
    should never be a factor in how people are treated.
 
 
    2) This verse fits very neatly with the last phrase in Colossians 3:25 that
states, “* And that without partiality* .” Fairness    ** <u>equates</u>**  with impartiality.
 
 
3) In light of this Scripture, Christian employers should seek to    ** <u>treat</u>**  their employees with equality.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
3. Colossians 4:1e – ** * Knowing* **     *  that you too have a ** <u>Master</u>**  in heaven* .
    Because of chapter breaks we sometimes lose continuity in our studies.
 
 
    a. The phrase * and that without partiality*  in Colossians 3:25
    neatly ** <u>ties</u>**  in with the spirit of this command to
    Christian masters. They too served the * Lord Christ* .
 
 
b. In terms of one’s standing in the church, masters were not    ** <u>over</u>**  the slaves they owned, and Paul reminded them
    of that fact. Often in churches today wealthy employers and business owners
    demand or receive respect above that of common workers in the body. This
    contradicts the spirit of this teaching.
 
 
    c. Christianity was totally radical in the first century world as it should
be today. It was totally possible that a slave could have become an    ** <u>elder</u>**  in the church and his earthly master could
    have become a sheep under his spiritual care.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4. Colossians 4:1f –
    * 
        Knowing that you ** <u>too</u>**  have a master in heaven
    * 
    . Paul sought to correct the motivations of Christian masters or employers.
 
 
    a. The Christian employer has a heavenly onlooker, God, who judges and
    observes all his ** <u>actions</u>**  toward his subordinates.
 
 
    b. As a Christian employer, cognizance of the fact that God is your boss
should cause you to relate to all your subordinates with    ** <u>equity</u>**  and equality. Philippians 4:5
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    5. In conclusion, Paul's ** <u>commands</u>**  to masters and
    servants could be summarized in employee employer relationship as follows:
 
 
    a. ** <u>Employers</u>** , keep in mind that God rules over you
    just as you rule over your employees. God knows if you are just and fair in
    your business practices or not. He expects impartiality.
 
 
    b. ** <u>Employees</u>** , God asks you to genuinely obey your
    boss. He expects you to work as though you were working for Christ not an
    earthly boss, keeping in mind that one day Christ will bless you with an
    inheritance that is out of this world.

    ** VII. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 4:2-7 – Changed Lives Through the Word of Christ
    ** 
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** Colossians 4:2-4 – Refreshing our prayer lives** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 4:2 – How should believers pray? Paul would say, “Pray
    earnestly, watchfully, and gratefully.”
 
 
a. Colossians 4:2a – * Devote yourselves to prayer* … We are to    ** <u>pray</u>**  with consistency. We are to be fervent in our
    prayer lives.
 
 
    1) ** * <u>Devote</u>* **  PROSKARTEREO carries the
    overtone of perseverance or persistence. Six of the ten uses of this word
    in the New Testament are in association with prayer. Acts 1:14, 2:46, 6:4;
    Romans 12:12; Ephesians 6:18
 
 
    2) Paul’s most fascinating use of the word * devoted*  PROSKARTEREO is
    found in Romans 13:6 where it describes the unceasing activity of
    government ** <u>tax</u>**  collectors. Just as tax collectors
    did not (and do not) give up on their task of tax collecting, we should not
    give up on our task of prayer.
 
 
    3) * Devote*  is a present tense imperative showing that prayer for
    the believer is to be a constant part of ** <u>life</u>** .
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    b. Colossians 4:2b – * Keeping ** <u>alert</u>**  in it* …
    We are to be intentionally vigilant and watchful in prayer.
 
 
1) To be * watchful*  GREGOREUO means to waken or    ** <u>rouse</u>**  from sleep. It has the idea of being ready
    for danger or emergency, to be on the lookout.
 
 
    2) The kind of prayer Paul wanted for the Colossians was vigilant prayer,
    because he knew the ** <u>dangers</u>**  that surrounded them.
    They were being bombarded by the heresies that he addressed in chapter two.
    This was not the time to sleep; they needed to be on guard duty. Luke 21:36
 
 
    3) When you rouse yourself you force yourself to be awake. That’s what is
    being implied here. We can so easily take a laidback stance in our
    Christianity, so Paul reminded the Colossian believers to instead be
    wide-awake and on high ** <u>alert</u>**  in their praying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    4) Perhaps one of the greatest needs for all believers in their prayer
    lives is to be spiritually ** <u>engaged</u>** . 1 Timothy
    2:1-4, 1 Peter 4:7
 
 
    a) Prayer for what is going on in our families, churches, communities,
    lives and government is always a ** <u>top</u>**  priority for
    us as believers. 1 Thessalonians 5:17
 
 
    b) Being watchful implies specific and purposeful prayer. Through this
    Scripture, the Holy Spirit is warning us not to be asleep, half-hearted or
    vague in our prayer ** <u>lives</u>** . Ephesians 6:18
 
 
    5) Do you realize the solemn importance of prayer?
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 4:2c – * With [an attitude of] thanksgiving* … An    ** <u>attitude</u>**  of heartfelt appreciation to God, should
    overflow into thankfulness in our prayers.
 
 
    1) True thankfulness or the lack thereof in our prayers is very revealing
    of ** <u>where</u>**  we are in our spiritual growth.
 
 
    a) Thankfulness shows your appreciation for what God has already done for
    you in the ** <u>past</u>** . Colossians 1:3-4
 
 
    b) Thankfulness shows your contentment and peace in accepting whatever God
    has for you in the ** <u>present</u>** . Romans 5:3-5,
    Colossians 4:12-13
 
 
    c) Thankfulness shows your confidence in God and His sovereign control over
    your ** <u>future</u>** . Only Christians can thank God in
    advance for what He will do because we know that whatever the outcome, He
    does everything well. Mark 7:37, John 11:41-43, Ephesians 6:18
 
 
    2) Paul did not say to be thankful if all goes ** <u>our</u>** 
    way. 1 Thessalonians 5:18
 
 
    a) Even when the outcome seems less than desirable, we are assured by God
    that He works all things together for our ** <u>good</u>** .
    Romans 8:28, 31; Colossians 1:12
 
 
    b) Have we learned to trust God regardless of the outcome of our prayers?
    Ephesians 3:20-21
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 4:3-4 – Even though Paul was a great missionary set apart by
    God, he was keenly aware of his personal ** <u>need</u>**  for
    prayer support. Paul knew that without God’s direct intervention he could
    do nothing of eternal value. Acts 20:24, 2 Corinthians 3:4-5, 2
    Thessalonians 3:1-2, 1 Timothy 1:12
 
 
    a. Colossians 4:3a –
    * 
        Praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a
        door for the word
    * 
. Paul asked the Colossians to pray for an open    ** <u>door</u>**  to speak forth God’s Word.
 
 
1) If we were in prison, we’d also ask the Lord for an    ** <u>open</u>**  door, but it would be to escape, not to speak.
    Acts 14:27
 
 
    2) Instead, Paul’s petition was for evangelistic opportunities. We know of
    at least ** <u>one</u>**  case where God answered this prayer in
    Onesimus, the runaway slave from Colossae. Colossians 4:9, Philemon 1:10-13
 
 
    b. Colossians 4:3b –
    * 
        So that we may ** <u>speak</u>**  forth the mystery of
        Christ.
    * 
    God had commissioned Paul to make known the mystery of Christ. Paul asked
    the Colossian believers to pray that God would open up opportunities to
    accomplish this goal. Romans 1:14-17, 16:25; 1 Corinthians 9:16-17;
    Philippians 1:18-20
 
 
    c. Colossians 4:3c – * For which I have also been imprisoned* . Paul
considered himself to be incarcerated because of the* mystery of Christ* . He willingly suffered for the Gospel’s    ** <u>sake</u>** . 2 Timothy 1:8, Hebrews 13:3
 
 
    d. Colossians 4:4a – * That I may make it clear* … Paul also wanted
them to pray for ** <u>clarity</u>**  in speaking the    * mystery of Christ* , the Gospel message. The mystery of Christ has
    to be believed by the unsaved for justification and by the saved for
    sanctification. Clarity in preaching is so important to accurate
    understanding.
 
 
    e. Colossians 4:4b – * In the way I ought to speak.*  The apostle Paul
    asked for prayer that he would be ** <u>faithful</u>**  to the
    task God had given him. What a testimony and what a challenge for us as
    well. Ephesians 6:18-20
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** Colossians 4:5-6 – Revitalizing our public testimonies** 
 
 
1. Colossians 4:5a –    * Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders* . Paul gave an
    important command concerning the believer’s behavior before unbelievers. He
    instructed believers to walk blamelessly ** <u>before</u>**  the
    world.
 
 
    a. We should understand that ** <u>our</u>**  testimony before
    the world does indeed matter.
 
 
    b. * Conduct yourself*  is a present tense active voice imperative
    emphasizing that this should be ** <u>done</u>**  as a normal
    part of everyday life.
 
 
    c. * With wisdom*  is more than mere knowledge. Wisdom is divine
    understanding that prompts us how to properly ** <u>apply</u>** 
    what we know to our everyday situations. We desperately need God’s wisdom
    as we order our lives before the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 4:5b-6 – Paul now pointed out three areas in which we should
    live ** <u>wisely</u>**  before the world.
 
 
    a. Colossians 4:5a – Be wise in your ** <u>walk</u>** . First,
    we are to * make the most of the opportunity* . We are to snatch up
    daily opportunities to minister to the world.
 
 
    1) The phrase * making the most of*  EXAGORAZO literally means to buy
out of or to redeem (as when something is purchased out from the    ** <u>market</u>**  place).
 
 
2) This commercial term pictured the savvy shopper who seizes a    ** <u>deal</u>**  when he or she sees one. Just as a shopper
    grabs a bargain at the right time, so the Christian is to seize
    opportunities to share Christ with unbelievers.
 
 
b. Colossians 4:6a – Be sharp in your ** <u>talk</u>** . Second,    * let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt* 
    . We are to be wise in our interaction with the unsaved world.
 
 
    1) Our speech should always …* be with ** <u>grace</u>** * 
    . As a believer your communication before the world should be winsome at
    all times. In this world a pleasant word spoken at the right time will give
    you opportunities and open doors that lead to evangelistic opportunities.
    Proverbs 15:23, 25:11
 
 
    2) This world is an unsavory place. Your speech with unsaved friends and
neighbors should be    * seasoned as it were with ** <u>salt</u>** * . Pack your
    words with the undiluted flavor of the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
 
c. Colossians 4:6c – Be ready, don’t ** <u>balk</u>** . Third, …    * so that you may know how you should respond to each person.*  Your
    circumspect walk before the world will give you opportunities and God will
    supply the words. James 1:5, 2 Timothy 4:17
    <br/>

# VIII.  Colossians 4:7-18 – Closing Comments, Commendations and Concerns
 
 
    ** A. ** 
    ** Some general observations about the people Paul esteemed** 
 
 
1. Paul mentioned all kinds of believers: Jews and Gentiles,    ** <u>male</u>**  and female, and slave and free. This
    highlights the unity that exists in the body of Christ in spite of the
    diversity. Ephesians 2:11-22, Galatians 3:26-28
 
 
    2. ** <u>Each</u>**  of the people mentioned was significant in
    some way to the Colossian church.
 
 
    3. If Christ were writing a letter to your church, what would His comments
    concerning you be? To God, these individuals were more than just a number.
    Do you see yourself as more than a ** <u>number</u>**  to our
    God?
 
 
    ** B. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 4:7-15a – Paul’s kind regards to and from individuals of
        high esteem
    ** 
 
 
1. Colossians 4:7-8 – Tychicus’ ** <u>name</u>**  meant    ** fortunate** . True to his name, this brother was an opportune
    and favorable messenger for Paul.
 
 
    a. Colossians 4:7a – * As to all my affairs, Tychicus… * Tychicus was
    a Gentile believer from the province of Asia and therefore he would have
been familiar with the customs, mindset, culture and    ** <u>needs</u>**  of the Colossians believers. Paul made a wise
    decision in choosing him to be the bearer of the Colossian letter. Acts
    20:4
 
 
    b. Colossians 4:7b –
    * 
        Our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the
        Lord
    * 
    … As a beloved and faithful bondservant of Christ, Tychicus was considered
    by Paul to be a dear ** <u>friend</u>**  and soul-mate in every
    respect.
 
 
    c. Colossians 4:7c – …* will bring you information* . These comments
    would be reason to carefully ** <u>listen</u>**  to him upon his
    arrival. Tychicus was going to share with them more information from Paul.
 
 
    d. Colossians 4:8 –
    * 
For I have sent him to you for this very        ** <u>purpose</u>** , that you may know about our
        circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts
    * 
    … Paul was sure Tychicus would answer their questions and encourage their
    hearts. Ephesians 6:21; 2 Timothy 2:2, 4:12; Titus 3:12
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    2. Colossians 4:9 – Onesimus’ name meant ** useful** .
    Interestingly he had been a worthless ** <u>slave</u>**  but
    became ** useful**  to Paul in the ministry. Philemon 10-21
 
 
    a. Colossians 4:9a – * And with him Onesimus* … Onesimus was a Gentile
    believer from the ** <u>town</u>**  of Colossae. Colossians 4:12
 
 
    b. Colossians 4:9b –
    * 
        Our faithful and beloved brother, who is ** <u>one</u>**  of
        your number
    * 
    . Onesimus was a runaway slave who had been converted and changed by God’s
    grace under Paul’s prison ministry. As a testament to the transforming
    power of the Gospel, Paul now considered him to be a faithful and dear
    brother. Philemon 16
 
 
c. Colossians 4:9c –    * They will inform you about the whole situation here* . Onesimus was
to be a traveling companion of Tychicus. He would turn himself over to his    ** <u>legal</u>**  owner, Philemon, when he arrived at Colossae.
    Together with Tychicus, he would also report to the church concerning
    Paul’s prison sufferings.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
3. Colossians 4:10-11 – Paul mentioned other important believers who also    ** <u>sent</u>**  their greetings to the church in Colossae.
 
 
    a. Colossians 4:10a – Aristarchus’ name meant ** best ruler** .
    Aristarchus was a Jewish believer from the city of Thessalonica in
    Macedonia who had a ** <u>Greek</u>**  name. He was a fellow
    believer who was suffering in chains together with Paul.
 
 
    1) Aristarchus knew what it meant to ** <u>suffer</u>**  for
    Christ. Once, in the city of Ephesus, he was seized by an angry mob during
    a riot. Acts 19:29
 
 
2) At the time of this writing, he was in prison for his    ** <u>faith</u>** . The word for fellow-prisoner means fellow
    prisoner-of-war. This implied that he was arrested by sword as if taken in
    war. Acts 27:2-4
 
 
3) Paul told Timothy, “If we endure, we will also** <u>reign</u>**  with Him.” True to his name    ** Best Ruler** , in eternity Aristarchus’ suffering will surely
    result in ** ruling**  authority. Acts 19:29, 20:4; 2 Timothy
    2:12a
 
 
    b. Colossians 4:10b – Mark’s name meant polite or ** shining** .
Mark had been a rude quitter who became a ** bright shining**     ** <u>worker</u>** . Acts 12:25
 
 
    1) Mark, also called John Mark, was the ** <u>cousin</u>**  of
    Barnabas. He was the cause of the split in Paul and Barnabas’ missionary
    team. Acts 15:37-39
 
 
    2) By the ** <u>grace</u>**  of God, in the end Mark totally
    turned around and became a faithful servant and a useful fellow worker of
    the apostle Paul. 2 Timothy 4:11, Philemon 24
 
 
    3) Mark ended up being the author of the gospel of Mark. Here Paul
admonished the Colossians to welcome him should he    ** <u>come</u>** . Why?
 
 
    4) It could be that they had heard of his previous dereliction of duty and
    Paul was afraid they might ** <u>reject</u>**  him if he were to
    visit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
c. Colossians 4:11a –    * Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings* . Justus' name
    meant ** righteous** . Justus was a Jewish believer in Christ
    who became one of Paul’s ** <u>fellow</u>**  workers. There are
a few possibilities in Scripture for the identity of this    ** righteous**  man.
 
 
    1) First, he may have been Joseph, called Barsabas (Justus), the runner-up
    to being the replacement for ** <u>Judas</u>** . Acts 1:23
 
 
2) Second, he may have been Titus Justus the Corinthian worshiper of    ** <u>God</u>** , who was likely a Jewish proselyte before His
    faith in Christ. Acts 18:7
 
 
    3) Third, an otherwise unknown Jewish ** <u>man</u>**  who was
    neither of the above.
 
 
    4) ** <u>Any</u>**  of these options would meet the
    qualification of being Jewish.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    d. Colossians 4:11b –
    * 
        These are the only ** <u>Jews</u>**  among my co-workers…
    * 
    For some unknown reason, Justus, Aristarchus and Mark were the only Jewish
    Christians who were working together with Paul at the time of his
    imprisonment in Rome.
 
 
    e. Colossians 4:11c –*  For the kingdom of God…*  Paul was not saying
    they were presently establishing the Kingdom, but he understood that the
    work we do now in the ** <u>Church</u>**  Age is a contribution
    to the coming Kingdom of God. Colossians 1:13
 
 
    1) In 2 Timothy 4:18 Paul shed some light on this when he said, “
    * 
The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed, and will        ** <u>bring</u>**  me safely to his heavenly kingdom
    * 
    .” One day Paul would be taken to the future kingdom.
 
 
    2) Also in Acts 14:22b Paul said, “
    * 
        Through many tribulations we must ** <u>enter</u>**  the
        kingdom of God
    * 
    .” The kingdom is yet future and we will enter it.
 
 
    f. Colossians 4:11b –*  And they have proved a comfort to me* . Paul
    confessed that these three Jewish Christians had been a true encouragement
    and ** <u>help</u>**  to him.
 
 
4. Colossians 4:12-13 – Epaphras’ name meant charming or** lovely** . Epaphras was a prayer warrior with a pastor’s** <u>heart</u>** , and there is nothing more    ** lovely**  than that.
 
 
    a. Colossians 4:12a –
    * 
        Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ sends
        you his greetings …
    * 
Epaphras was from the Colossian congregation and was very likely the key    ** <u>person</u>**  in the evangelism and establishment of the
    church. Colossians 1:7
 
 
b. Colossians 4:12b –    * [He is] always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers…*  Epaphras
    was the ** <u>only</u>**  believer the apostle Paul ever singled
    out as a prayer warrior.
 
 
1) Prayer for their spiritual growth – He prayed …    * that [they] may stand perfect…*  This is similar in focus to Paul’s
prayers for them in Colossians 1:9-12. Epaphras prayed for their    ** * perfection* ** , meaning that they would reach their
    full ** <u>goal</u>** , be finished, and achieve all the
    fullness that God wanted for them.
 
 
    2) Prayer for their spiritual understanding – Epaphras also prayed that
they’d be    * …** <u>fully</u>**  assured in all the will of God.*  The
    issue of * full assurance of understanding*  concerning God’s will was
    also a focus in Paul’s prayers for the Colossians. Colossians 1:9, 2:1-3
 
 
    3) Why pray for these two issues? Why not pray for needs like better jobs,
    better health, a better political climate, or financial security?
 
 
4) Epaphras prayed this way simply because if God would    ** <u>grant</u>**  these two areas of spiritual growth and
    understanding, he knew they would thrive and be fruitful for God’s sake and
    glory regardless of their lot in life.
 
 
    c. Colossians 4:13 –
    * 
        For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those
        who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis
    * 
    . Epaphras had a ** <u>real</u>**  passion for the well-being of
    the Colossians and their sister churches in the Lycos valley.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
5. Colossians 4:14 –    * Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings* . Luke's name
    meant ** light-giving** . Luke was a medical doctor who became a
beloved companion of the apostle Paul on his journeys. He indeed    ** brightened**  Paul’s ** <u>life</u>**  with his
    company. Luke was also a careful historian. He wrote the books of Luke and
    Acts.
 
 
    6. Colossians 4:14 – Demas' name meant ** popular** . Demas is
    mentioned ** <u>three</u>**  times in the New Testament.
    Although Demas was at this point a devoted worker, later, when it was no
    longer ** popular**  or convenient to be a Christian, his love
    for the world returned. Colossians 4:14, Philemon 24, 2 Timothy 4:10
 
 
7. Colossians 4:15a –    * And also Nympha and the church that is in her house* … Nympha, a
    sister in the Lord whose name meant ** bride,**  hosted a local
congregation, the ** bride**  of Christ, in her    ** <u>home</u>** .
 
 
    a. In those days, churches often met in ** <u>homes</u>** . For
    Nympha to host the congregation in her home would have been a great honor
    as well as responsibility. Romans 16:5, 1 Corinthians 16:19, Philemon 2
 
 
    b. Church buildings were not utilized ** <u>until</u>**  around
    the third century AD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
 
 
    ** C. ** 
    ** 
        Colossians 4:15b-18 – Paul made some <u>farewell</u> statements.
    ** 
 
 
    1. Colossians 4:15b – A ** G** reeting to the churches of
Laodicea: ** * <u>Greet</u>* **     *  the brethren who are in Laodicea.* 
 
 
2. Colossians 4:16 – An ** O** bligation to    ** <u>read</u>**  the Word:
    * 
When this letter is ** read**  among you, have it also        ** read**  in the church of the Laodiceans and you, for your
        part ** read**  my letter that is coming from Laodicea.
    * 
    The letter coming from Laodicea was probably the book of Ephesians that
    would eventually make its way to Colossae.
 
 
3. Colossians 4:17 – An ** O** rder for Archippus to    ** <u>fulfill</u>**  his ministry:
    * 
        Say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in
        the Lord, that you may fulfill it.”
    * 
    We do not know what ministry Archippus had, but he needed encouragement to
    accomplish it. Sometimes we also need encouragement to do our
    responsibilities.
 
 
4. Colossians 4:18a – A ** D** elineation:** <u>Paul's</u>**  personal signature.    * I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand* . This personal touch
    was Paul’s way of preventing forgeries. In those days, this was sometimes a
