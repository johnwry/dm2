**Colossians**
**Christ is All You Need**
___
Paul wrote this short letter of 95 verses from a prison cell in Rome. You might call this Paul's "95 Thesis" on the authority and adequacy of Christ. You will never find a greater discourse on the greatness of Christ. A careful study of Colossians will furnish a humble appreciation of the supreme authority and absolute adequacy of Jesus Christ.
___
The apostle Paul expressed that Jesus Christ is the ultimate authority and complete sustainer of the Christian. He proclaimed Christ as the one and only fountain that is able to completely satisfy our thirst. Through the apostle Paul, the Holy Spirit warned the Colossians of the shallowness of philosophy, legalism, mysticism and asceticism. These are cheap substitutes for Christ living in and through you. Paul showed that human philosophy cannot provide an explanation for, or an understanding of, life. Each of these errors takes your eyes off Jesus as the source and sustainer of your life. Colossians answers the question: "Is Christ enough?" or more specifically,"Is He enough for you?"
___
It is significant that the Holy Spirit is only mentioned once in this narrative (Col.1:8). By explaining the Christian life without stressing the Holy Spirit, Paul removed the tendency toward mysticism by showing that the Holy Spirit's ministry is ultimately *Christ in you*. In an era (AD 2016) when the Holy Spirit's work is mystified, the emphasis of Paul in Colossians is a must-study. Whereas some teach that believers are lacking and need a second blessing or some novel experience to be complete, Colossians emphasizes just the opposite, stating we are already complete in Christ.
___
**The Authority of Christ**-- Do you believe that Jesus Christ the Creator rules supreme and sovereign over His creation? Do you acknowledge that in creation He is above everything including all so-called gods, angels, demons, animals and people? All of us ought to pause and honestly ask if there is anything eclipsing Christ in our thinking. Although many people in our day confess that Christ is good or important, they see Him as just one authority among many. If that describes you, the book of Colossians was designed to change your mind.
___
**The Adequacy of Christ**-- Do you believe that Christ is adequate? Are you convinced that Jesus Christ is sufficient for all your spiritual needs? Is Jesus Christ ***part*** of the answer or is He ***the*** answer itself? Do you find yourself looking to religious activities like fasting, deeper devotion or penance to keep you in line spiritually? What influence does modern-day secular philosophy have on your mind? In the book of Colossians you will learn that nothing can ever replace Jesus Christ in meeting your spiritual needs. While many Christians believe that Christ is good for their lives, they are not quite convinced He is enough.
___
Colossians exalts Jesus Christ and shows that anything that takes you away from a dependence on Him is illegitimate.

**The Book of Colossians**
***Christ is all you need\***

# I. Colossians 1:1-2 -- An Introduction to the Book 

## A. An analysis of Colossians 

### 1. A short **<u>history</u>** of Colossae

#### a. Colossae was a town in **<u>central</u>** Asia Minor, or modern-day Turkey.

#### b. Historically it was a **<u>major</u>** city in the southwestern part of the Phrygian Empire (BC 1200-800) that predated the arrival of the Greeks under Alexander the Great.

#### c. There were two **<u>cities</u>** that formed a triangle with the city of Colossae. They were Laodicea (Rev.3:14-22) and Hierapolis. Colossians 4:13

##### 1. By the time of Paul's writing, Colossae had been dwarfed in both **<u>size</u>** and importance by Laodicea and Hierapolis.

##### 2. In his commentary on Colossians, Bishop Lightfoot wrote,"Without doubt Colossae was the **<u>least</u>** important church to which any epistle of St. Paul is addressed."

#### d. Colossae hosted a prosperous **<u>textile</u>** industry and was particularly famous for its dark (crimson, purple, or glossy black) wool, called colosseum.

#### e. For centuries a major **<u>trade</u>** route (highway) that went from Ephesus to the Upper Euphrates traversed Colossae.

##### 1. Later, around the **<u>fifth</u>** century BC, the road was rerouted through Laodicea.

##### 2. Many conclude that this contributed to the weakening of Colossae, eventually relegating it to a mere **<u>country</u>** village.

#### f. Occasionally invading **<u>armies</u>** traveling to or from Europe trampled the area of Colossae.

### 2. The **<u>state</u>** of Colossae

#### a. The inhabitants of the city would have been mainly Gentile, though it is said that the Assyrian Empire exiled some 2,000 or more Israelites to the region in the fifth century BC. Even so, the majority of the inhabitants were **<u>native</u>** Phrygians or Greeks.

#### b. Though much smaller than its neighbors, Colossae enjoyed its share of **<u>wealth</u>**.

#### c. History tells us a terrible earthquake destroyed Colossae in AD 60 during the reign of the Emperor Nero. Even though it was later rebuilt, Colossae never regained its former **<u>status</u>**-- a status that was already fading in Paul's day.

#### d. Due to Turkish incursions in the twelfth century AD, the **<u>city</u>** fell and the site was completely abandoned.

#### e. Today Colossae lies in ruins in the Lycos Valley, smothered beneath 800 years of **<u>dirt</u>** and debris.

#### f. Only recently have excavations begun, causing excitement in both the Christian and secular archeological **<u>worlds</u>**.

### 3. The **<u>church</u>** of Colossae

#### a. Paul likely traveled near the city on his second missionary **<u>journey</u>** but did not have God's approval to evangelize there. Acts 16:6-8, Colossians 2:1

##### 1. The evangelization of Colossae is believed to have been the **<u>work</u>** of Epaphras (Col.1:7,4:12-13), a believer who may have been saved under Paul's ministry (third missionary trip) during his three-year stint in Ephesus (100 miles to the east). Acts 19:10,20:31

##### 2. Additionally, it may have been during Paul's stay in Ephesus that Philemon was **<u>led</u>** to the Lord (Philemon 19). At some point the church of Colossae chose to assemble in Philemon's home for their meetings.

#### b. Whatever the case, Paul heard about their **<u>faith</u>**(Col.1:4,8,9; 2:1) as well as some serious errors that required immediate clarification and correction.

##### 1. Amazingly, the writing of this text in AD 60-61 would have been just before, or even just after, the earthquake of AD 60. Needless to say, Paul seemed totally unaware of that **<u>event</u>** when he wrote.

##### 2. As he penned this **<u>epistle</u>**, Paul was enduring his first incarceration in the city of Rome. He was awaiting trial due to his appeal to Caesar.

#### c. The Colossian church seems to have eventually succumbed to **<u>angel</u>** worship. Michael the Archangel became known as the protecting saint of the city. He supposedly saved it from a disastrous flood as reflected in medieval art.

## B.**The attack on the Colossians**

### 1. Satan attacks God's work through the spreading of false gospels or through teaching false **<u>methods</u>** of Christian living. If the devil can distract a Christian from the adequacy of Christ by any means, he is happy. Colossians 2:1-4; 2 Corinthians 2:11,11:3,14; Ephesians 6:12; 1 Peter 5:8-9; James 4:7

### 2. The false teachings of ancient Colossae did not completely **<u>deny</u>** Jesus Christ as Savior. Instead they cleverly diminished His authority as God come in the flesh. They put Christ in an inferior light in the minds of naive believers.

### 3. False teaching on how to live a victorious Christian life almost always **<u>attacks</u>** Christ's authority and adequacy. The message becomes,"Jesus Christ plus whatever (fill in the blank) equals successful Christian living."

### 4. What was taking the focus off the preeminence and adequacy of Christ in Colossae?

#### a.**Human philosophy**: This **<u>error</u>** teaches that you need Christ plus philosophy for successful Christian living.

##### 1. This subtle seduction suggests that there are those who are in the **<u>know</u>** versus the ignorant.

##### 2. This error keeps you **<u>looking</u>** to human knowledge and secular philosophy for the answers to life's questions instead of looking to Christ alone. Colossians 2:6-10

#### b.**Ritualistic legalism**: This falsehood teaches that by strict obedience to certain rituals, rules or regulations you can come to merit God's favor. This error deceives you into taking your eyes off Christ and putting them on your own **<u>efforts</u>** and achievements to reach spirituality. Colossians 2:16-17

#### c.**Experiential mysticism**: This erroneous belief implies that you are lacking and in need of something **<u>more</u>** in order to become a complete Christian. This error often involves a need to have visions, personal prophecies, encounters with angels, or supernatural experiences.

##### 1. This **<u>false</u>** focus invariably thrives on emotions and experiences over and above the Word of God.

##### 2. This mistake causes believers to **<u>look</u>** to experience for spirituality instead of to Christ. Colossians 2:18-19

#### d.**Personal asceticism**: This popular concept proposes that self-denial, austerity, isolation, self-depravation, or greater religious fervor is the real **<u>key</u>** to spirituality.

##### 1. Interestingly, Paul pointed out that these won't keep you from indulging your **<u>flesh</u>**. Colossians 2:20-23

##### 2. Instead of the abundant life being by faith through **<u>grace</u>**, this concept erroneously looks at self-depravation or self-abasement as the key to abundant living.

### 5. All four of these errors are constantly repackaged, often by well-meaning Christian leaders or famous authors, and reoffered to the church as the "key" or "**<u>secret</u>**" to a deeper Christian life.

### 6. All of these misconceptions were eventually encapsulated in Gnosticism, which in one form or another still exists **<u>today</u>**. Without doubt, until Christ returns these heresies will remain an ongoing and constant threat to our spiritual progress. Thank God for the clarifications found in the book of Colossians.

## C.**The arrangement of Colossians**

### 1. This epistle breaks up into **<u>three</u>** sections.

#### a. Chapter 1 -- Knowing Jesus Christ as preeminent and adequate for **<u>you</u>**

#### b. Chapter 2 -- Understanding your standing in Jesus Christ and that **<u>true</u>** spirituality comes by means of God's grace through dependent faith versus the counterfeits

#### c. Chapters 3-4 -- Living your life by faith in the adequacy of Christ, empowered by **<u>Him</u>** to do His will

### 2. There are 11 verses in this epistle that highlight our position in Christ.

#### a. Colossians 1:2 -- We are in **<u>Christ</u>**.

#### b. Colossians 2:7 -- We are **<u>rooted</u>** in Christ.

#### c. Colossians 2:7 -- We are **<u>built</u>** up in Christ.

#### d. Colossians 2:10 -- We are **<u>complete</u>** in Christ.

#### e. Colossians 2:11 -- We have been **<u>crucified</u>** with Christ.

#### f. Colossians 2:12 -- We have been **<u>buried</u>** with Christ.

#### g. Colossians 2:13 -- We are **<u>alive</u>** now with Christ.

#### h. Colossians 2:20 -- We are **<u>dead</u>** with Christ to the world system.

#### i. Colossians 3:1 -- We have been **<u>raised</u>** up together with Christ.

#### j. Colossians 3:3 -- We are **<u>hidden</u>** with Christ in God.

## D.**Colossians 1:1-2a -- The Authorship of Colossians**

### 1. Colossians 1:1a -- Paul signed his name as the **<u>author</u>** of this letter.

#### a. At birth Paul was named Saul. Saul was a Jewish name that signified "great one" or someone of **<u>great</u>** importance.

##### 1. Paul was born to **<u>Jewish</u>** parents in the Roman military enclave of Tarsus. His parents must have been somewhat affluent since they had him tutored under Gamaliel, a premiere teacher of Judaism in that day. Acts 22:3

##### 2. Paul was **<u>born</u>** with Roman citizenship. His father may have gained Roman citizenship through military service. To gain citizenship by means of military service you needed to have served a minimum of 25 years and received an honorable discharge. Acts 5:34,22:25-29

##### 3. History provides only one brief description of Paul from an uncertain source: *a man of **<u>small</u>** stature, with a bald head and crooked legs, in a good state of body, with eyebrows meeting and nose somewhat hooked, full of friendliness, for now he appeared like a man, and now he had the face of an angel*.

#### b. As we see in the epistles, Saul was later referred to almost exclusively as **<u>Paul</u>**, meaning small or little one.

##### 1. He was **<u>initially</u>** identified as Paul on his first missionary journey in Acts 13.

##### 2. Constantly being called **<u>Little</u>** One would have been an ongoing reminder to the apostle of his need for God's grace. Paul's unreserved acceptance of this nickname showed genuine humility.

#### c. A **<u>short</u>** history of Paul

##### 1.**<u>Before</u>** salvation, Paul was extremely religious and self-righteous. Galatians 1:14, Philippians 3:4-9,1 Timothy 1:12-15

##### 2. Paul **<u>was</u>** an aggressive persecutor of Christians. Acts 22:4,26:10-11; Galatians 1:13

##### 3. Paul was saved in a dramatic and sudden occurrence on a **<u>road</u>** that led to the city of Damascus. Acts 9

##### 4. Paul was set apart by Christ as His **<u>apostle</u>** to the Gentiles. Acts 9:15-16,1 Corinthians 15:8-10, Galatians 2:8

##### 5. Paul served God on **<u>three</u>** missionary journeys. Acts 13-20

##### 6. Paul **<u>wrote</u>**13 foundational books of the New Testament.

##### 7. Paul suffered greatly for Christ with beatings, a **<u>stoning</u>**, imprisonments and finally execution in Rome around AD 67.2 Corinthians 11:23-28

### 2. Colossians 1:1a -- In the church, Paul possessed God-given authority as an **<u>apostle</u>**.

#### a. Paul was *an apostle of Jesus Christ*. Christ saved Paul and **<u>sent</u>** him forth as an apostle, specifically dedicated to the Gentiles. Acts 9:15-16,22:21; Romans 11:13; Galatians 2:8; 1 Timothy 2:7; 2 Timothy 1:11

#### b. Paul was an apostle *by the will of **<u>God</u>*** and not by personal ambition or human appointment. Let's consider some general information on apostleship. Galatians 1:1,1 Corinthians 1:1,2 Timothy 1:1

##### 1. The word apostle means **<u>sent</u>** one. The apostles were personally chosen and commissioned into service by the resurrected Lord Jesus.1 Corinthians 9:1,15:7-9, Acts 9:3-6

##### 2. As official representatives of Jesus Christ and divinely commissioned, the apostles laid the foundation of the **<u>church</u>**. Apostles were God's spokesmen.1 Corinthians 9:1-2; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Ephesians 2:19-20,4:12-13; 2 Peter 3:2b

##### 3. Apostles became the spiritual authorities in the **<u>early</u>** church and were used by God to write much of the New Testament.1 Corinthians 4:8-13,12:28; 1 Thessalonians 2:6; Jude 17

##### 4. There were only twelve apostles appointed **<u>directly</u>** by the Lamb (Rev.21:14). There are no new apostles being commissioned directly by God today.1 Corinthians 15:7-10, Ephesians 2:20

### 3. Colossians 1:1b --*And Timothy our brother*... Timothy, a **<u>fellow</u>** believer in Jesus Christ, was one of Paul's assistants in ministry.

#### a. Timothy was the son of a **<u>Greek</u>** father and a believing Jewish mother. Acts 16:1,2 Timothy 1:5

#### b. Timothy grew up in Lystra, where Paul was almost **<u>stoned</u>** to death. Acts 16:2

#### c. He trusted **<u>Christ</u>** through the ministry of Paul. Acts 14:8-20

#### d. Timothy was a **<u>great</u>** encouragement to the apostle Paul. Philippians 2:19-23

#### e. He was Paul's **<u>faithful</u>** fellow servant. Acts 14:6-23,16-19; 1 Timothy 1:3; 2 Timothy 1:5,3:15

## E.**Colossians 1:2****-- The Addressees in Colossae**

### 1. Colossians 1:2a --*To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ...* As a **<u>group</u>**, the recipients of this letter were identified as holy and trustworthy brothers in Christ.

#### a. They were called ***saints**,* which means sanctified or set **<u>apart</u>** ones. This is a positional statement.

##### 1. Saints speaks of the Christian's standing in **<u>perfect</u>** righteousness before God as already holy. This standing is true of all believers.

##### 2. The description ***saints*** is the single most used designation or **<u>title</u>** for Christians in the entire New Testament.

##### 3. This description, or title, speaks of the believer's unchanging position in Christ based on God's acceptance of the finished **<u>work</u>** of Christ.

#### b.*And****faithful brethren***... This description of the Colossian believers depicts them as faithful **<u>family</u>** members. This is a conditional statement.

##### 1. This description spotlighted the Colossians consistent walk of **<u>faith</u>**.

##### 2. The mention of ***<u>faithful</u>****brethren* in Paul's introduction suggests the possibility of the existence of unfaithful believers in the church.

##### 3. Obviously God desires that a believer's condition or **<u>daily</u>** practice (*faithful brethren*) be in alignment with his or her unchanging position in Christ (*saints*).

##### 4. When this is a reality in a believer's practice, we call it walking by means of the Spirit or walking by **<u>faith</u>**.2 Corinthians 5:7, Galatians 5:16

### 2. Colossians 1:2b -- Paul addressed the faithful ***brethren****<u>in Christ</u>****who are at Colossae***. We see that even though they were physically residing in the city of Colossae, spiritually they were found ***in Christ***.

## F.**Colossians 1:2c -- An amiable greeting to the Colossians**

### 1. When Paul said,"***<u>Grace</u>****to you,*" he was expressing his desire for a special blessing for the Colossian believers.

#### a.**<u>Every</u>** epistle Paul wrote started and finished with a statement about grace. Colossians 1:2,4:18

#### b. Paul believed that **<u>life</u>** for the believer was to be lived by grace. Do you?

### 2.*And **<u>peace</u>**...* Paul also desired God's peace to rest over them.

#### a. True peace comes from an understanding of God's **<u>grace</u>**.

#### b. Does peace describe **<u>your</u>** life?

### 3. Colossians 1:2b -- The statement ***from** God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ* shows the only true **<u>source</u>** from which both grace and peace originate.

#### a. We should also notice the word **<u>order</u>** of grace first and then peace.

#### b. Truly you cannot experience peace without **<u>first</u>** being a recipient of God's amazing grace.

# II.**Colossians 1:3-14 -- Paul's Three-focused Prayer**

## A.**Colossians 1:3-6 -- Part one: Paul's prayer of thanksgiving**

### 1. Colossians 1:3-6 constitutes a single **<u>run-on</u>** sentence in Greek. Paul's thanksgiving for God's work of grace in these believers overflowed into a prayer for them to grow in their understanding of God's will so that they would continue to bear fruit and please God.

### 2. Colossians 1:3 -- Paul gave God thanks for his **<u>fellow</u>** believers in Colossae.

#### a. Colossians 1:3a --*We give thanks*... Typical of Paul, he began his prayer by giving **<u>thanks</u>** for his readers. Philippians 1:3, Romans 1:8, Ephesians 1:15-16

##### 1. By saying,"***<u>We</u>** give thanks,*" Paul made it obvious that other believers were involved in intercession for the Colossians.

##### 2. The Greek verb translated *give thanks* EU**CARIS**TOUMEN contains the word **<u>grace</u>** as its root.*Give thanks* literally means to joyfully speak of grace. In this case, Paul was joyfully speaking of the grace **of God** towards the Colossian believers.

##### 3. The verb is in the present tense, denoting the continual aspect of Paul's thanksgiving. Paul and his companions continually **<u>gave</u>** thanks for the Colossians.

##### 4. When you get a glimpse of God and start to grasp His undeserved provisions, you cannot **<u>help</u>** but give Him thanks. Thankfulness is a central motivation in living the Christian life. True to this fact, Paul showed gratitude in every chapter of Colossians. Colossians 1:3,1:12,2:7,3:15-17,4:2

##### 5. We should not lose sight of the fact that Paul was in **<u>prison</u>** as he gave thanks here. Are you full of thanksgiving in the midst of your life's trials? James 1:2

#### b. Colossians 1:3b -- He gave thanks to *the **<u>Father</u>** of our Lord Jesus Christ*.

##### 1. Paul could have simply stated,"We give thanks to God the Father," without mentioning He was *the **<u>Father</u>** of our Lord Jesus Christ*.

##### 2. This statement should bring to mind that just as God was always a faithful Father to our Lord Jesus Christ while He was on earth, He is a faithful Father to **<u>us</u>** as well. Romans 8:15, Galatians 4:6

##### 3. The same privileged position **<u>Jesus</u>** enjoys as a son, you also enjoy today. Ephesians 1:3, John 17:23

#### c. Colossians 1:3c --*Praying always for you*... Paul wanted to let the Colossians know they were not **<u>alone</u>** in the battle of life; he and his fellow believers were consistently praying for them.

##### 1.*Praying **<u>always</u>**...* Paul reminded them he was praying regularly for them.

##### 2. Later at the end of this **<u>letter</u>**, he directed them in like manner to be devoted to prayer. Colossians 4:2

##### 3. Paul's exhortation to those under his care to ***<u>pray</u>** always*(Col.4:2) came on the heels of his example. In essence, Paul's example says,"Do as I say and do." He was not communicating,"Do as I say, but not as I do."

### 3. Colossians 1:4-5b -- The motivation of Paul's thankfulness was the pervasive testimony of the faith,**<u>love</u>** and hope of the Colossians.

#### a. Colossians 1:4a --*Your **<u>faith</u>** in Christ Jesus*... Notice Paul first focused on their faith, not on their works. Why might that be? If a believer has a vibrant faith in Christ, his faith will translate into commendable works before God. Romans 1:5,16:26

#### b. Colossians 1:4b --*Your faith **<u>in</u> Christ Jesus***... Next Paul focused on their faith specifically being *in Christ Jesus*. Their faith in the person of Christ inspired Paul's thanksgiving.

##### 1. Their *...faith in Christ Jesus*... could refer to the fact that they believed in Christ and were **<u>saved</u>** by faith, but in this verse Paul included their faith together with their love, showing he was not speaking solely of their initial faith in Christ for salvation. He was also speaking about their daily walk of faith. Galatians 2:20

##### 2. Paul referred to the fact that they were **<u>daily</u>** walking by faith. This is comparable to Paul's comments about the faith of the Thessalonians: *Constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ*.1 Thessalonians 1:3

###### a. If someone were to thank God for you, would they mention your walk of faith?

###### b. What is the object of your faith today? Is your life built on an ongoing walk of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, or do you trust in men, or worse yet your own strength? Jeremiah 17:5-8

#### c. Colossians 1:4c --*And of the love AGAPE which you have for all the saints*... Paul was thankful to hear of their unselfish love toward the whole **<u>body</u>** of Christ. John 15:12

##### 1. Romans 5:8 describes AGAPE love as both unmerited and **<u>self</u>**-sacrificial.

##### 2.1 Corinthians 13:4-8 details 16 interrelated qualities **<u>found</u>** in AGAPE love.

##### 3. In Galatians 5:16,22-23 we learn that AGAPE love is a fruit of the Spirit in the **<u>life</u>** of the believer as he or she walks by faith in the power of the Holy Spirit and not the product of self-effort or resolve. Colossians 1:8, Galatians 5:22,1 Timothy 1:4-5

#### d. Colossians 1:5a --*Because of the hope laid up for you in heaven*... The Colossians' walk of faith and love for one another were the result of their sure **<u>hope</u>**.

##### 1. The Colossian believers were living with a **<u>focus</u>** on eternity and not allowing their present sufferings to crush their spirit. Ephesians 1:18, Colossians 3:2-4, Hebrews 12:1-3

##### 2. By definition, biblical hope is confident expectation as opposed to **<u>doubt</u>**. Hope in the New Testament denotes certainty.

##### 3. As with faith, hope has an **<u>object</u>**. Hope is always based on God's Word and His faithfulness. Romans 8:24-25,15:13; 1 Corinthians 13:13

#### e. Colossians 1:5b --**Hope**...*of which you previously **<u>heard</u>** in the word of truth, the gospel*. Paul gave thanks because ever since day one of their salvation they had unwaveringly held on to their hope.

### 4. Colossians 1:5c-6 -- Paul gave thanks to God for the extent of the Gospel's **<u>reach</u>**.*...the word of truth, the gospel... which has come to you*.

#### a. Colossians 1:5c -- What is *the word of truth, the gospel* that Paul mentioned here?

##### 1. Paul is not using the word gospel here as a general term for good news. He is referring specifically to the message of **<u>truth</u>** that is to be preached and believed for salvation.

##### 2. Gospel here refers to the **<u>saving</u>** message as found in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4.

#### b. Colossians 1:6a -- The Gospel ...*which has come to you*. Remarkably the Gospel had reached even as **<u>far</u>** as the declining town of Colossae.

#### c. Colossians 1:6b --*...just as in **all the world** also*... Paul gave thanks that the Gospel message had reached **<u>them</u>**, just like it was reaching all the rest of the world.

##### 1. The life-changing Gospel message is for the entire world, whereas typically false teachings are represented as for only the exclusive or privileged **<u>few</u>**.1 Timothy 2:4

##### 2. The worldwide offer of the Gospel stands in stark contrast to the exclusive or **<u>secret</u>** messages taught by false teachers.

#### d. Colossians 1:6c --*...constantly bearing fruit and increasing...* Paul gave God thanks that the Gospel was spreading all over the **<u>world</u>**, and that as it spread, people were being saved and lives transformed. Romans 1:17

#### e. Colossians 1:6d --...*even as **it has been doing in you** also...* Paul gave particular **<u>thanks</u>** for the impact of the *grace of God* on the lives of the Colossian believers as proved by their own personal transformation.

#### f. Colossians 1:6e --...*since the day you heard of it*... The unsaved individual must **<u>hear</u>** the message of Christ's death for his sins and Christ's resurrection in order to be able to respond by faith and be saved. Romans 1:16,10:17; Ephesians 1:13

#### g. Colossians 1:6f --...*and understood the grace of God in **<u>truth</u>***. The realization of what we deserve for our sins and what God did for us in Christ's death becomes the appropriate basis for a correct understanding of grace.

##### 1. An accurate understanding of the grace of God is essential for **<u>initial</u>** salvation. Romans 1:17

###### a. Grace is not God's **<u>love</u>** separate from God's justice. God did not ignore His justice in order to show us His grace. Philippians 1:9,2 Peter 3:18

###### b. When Christ died on the cross as our substitute, God not only revealed His perfect **<u>love</u>**, Christ also satisfied God's righteous demands on our behalf. There is no greater picture of justice served than Christ's death for sin. Romans 5:8,8:32; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Colossians 2:13-14

##### 2. Understanding the grace of God in truth is not only important for our eternal salvation from sin's penalty (phase one salvation) but also for our practical salvation from sin's **<u>power</u>**(phase two salvation).

###### a. We are not saved on the basis of our **<u>works</u>**. We are saved by faith in the person and work of Christ. Romans 11:6, Galatians 2:21,1 Peter 5:12b

###### b. We cannot live the Christian life by our own works either. The Christian life is by faith as we **<u>depend</u>** on Christ and His provisions on our behalf. Romans 1:17, Galatians 2:20

### 5. Colossians 1:6 --...*Since the day you heard of it \[the gospel\] and understood the grace of God in truth*. Let's take a closer look at the **<u>Gospel</u>** from 1 Corinthians 15:1-10.

#### a.1 Corinthians 15:1 -- The New Testament word *gospel* EUANGELION simply means **<u>good</u>** news. The context defines the good news. When it comes to the saving message or the Gospel of our salvation, we discover the following:

##### 1. God has some really good news for **<u>all</u>** of humanity. Acts 17:30-31

##### 2. The good news is that God has done everything necessary for **<u>our</u>** salvation. John 19:30

##### 3. The good news is that **<u>sin</u>** has been paid in full by the death of Jesus Christ God's Son. Hebrews 10:12

##### 4. The good news is that we can have eternal life because long ago Christ died for our sins and **<u>rose</u>** again just as the Scriptures predicted He would. Romans 4:24-25,1 Corinthians 15:3-4,1 Thessalonians 4:14a

##### 5. The Gospel is all about what **<u>God</u>** has done to save sinners through the person and work of Christ.1 Corinthians 15:1-5a,11

#### b.1 Corinthians 15:3a --*For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received,**that Christ***... The **<u>person</u>** who authored the Gospel is Jesus Christ.

##### 1. The word *Christ* in Greek is a much more loaded **<u>word</u>** than what we perceive in English. When Paul used the term *the Christ* he was talking about the one and only prophesied Deliverer. Genesis 3:15, Acts 10:36, Romans 1:3-4

##### 2. We often think of the term *Christ* as merely Jesus'**<u>last</u>** name, but actually the concept is far more meaningful than that. The *Christ* was the coming Deliverer, or Messiah, promised back in the Garden of Eden. He was to be God's Anointed One sent to rescue us. Luke 2:11, Acts 2:36

###### a. The term Christ is the Greek equivalent of the **<u>Hebrew</u>** word Messiah. Messiah means anointed one.

###### b. The concept of an **anointed one** comes from the Old Testament where a **<u>prophet</u>** would anoint a chosen person with oil to signify God's selection of that person for service.1 Samuel 24:6, Psalm 105:15, Matthew 12:17-18

##### 3. The Christ was God's chosen instrument set **<u>apart</u>** for the work of saving all who come to God by faith.

##### 4. As the Christ, or anointed one, Jesus was the one chosen by God to be the Savior of the **<u>world</u>**. Jesus Christ is the long-awaited Messiah. Isaiah 42:1,61:1, Luke 4:16-21

##### 5. Therefore the Gospel had to do first of all with Jesus being the Christ who was appointed by God to come as a **<u>human</u>** and save mankind from sin. John 1:29-34

#### c.1 Corinthians 15:3b --*Christ **<u>died</u>***\[in our place, for our sins\]. The Gospel message includes the work accomplished by Christ's substitutionary death for us. Luke 24:27

##### 1.1 Corinthians 15:3 -- The phrase *Christ died* is at the heart of the Gospel. If for salvation you trust in anything **<u>other</u>** than the death of Christ you will not be saved. Your faith must rest in Christ alone.

##### 2. The Bible affirms that *the wages for sin is death*. When Christ died for our sins, He **<u>paid</u>** the price for our forgiveness. Christ's death was the appropriate, sufficient and only payment for our redemption.

#### d.1 Corinthians 15:3c --*Christ died for our **<u>sins</u>***... The great accomplishment of the Gospel is Christ's death for our personal sins. His death was the once-for-all payment for sins. His one-time payment provided everything necessary for our complete forgiveness.

##### 1. Christ died so that God could **<u>forgive</u>** sin forever.*For the wages of sin is death*(Rom.6:23). Through His death, Christ paid your sin debt.

##### 2. Nothing more needs to be done to resolve the sin issue between holy God and sinful man. Sin was completely dealt with on the **<u>cross</u>** of Christ. There is no longer any need for a sacrifice.1 Peter 3:18

#### e.1 Corinthians 15:3d --***Christ died***...*according to the Scriptures and was buried*. We have two great confirmations that Christ did indeed **<u>die</u>** for our sins. The first is fulfilled prophetic testimony from the Old Testament, and the second is the fact that His lifeless body was placed in a tomb on a day in history.

#### f.1 Corinthians 15:4-5a --...***and that he was raised on the third day** according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared...* We also have two confirmations of Christ's literal **<u>bodily</u>** resurrection. First we have the literal fulfillment of Old Testament Scripture and second we have eyewitness testimonies.

##### 1. Christ is a **<u>living</u>** Savior. If Christ were still dead, He could not to save anyone. Hebrews 7:25

##### 2. Christ is the source of eternal life. Having been **<u>raised</u>** from the dead, Christ now offers eternal life to all who believe in Him. Romans 4:24-25, John 6:40

#### g.1 Corinthians 15:11 -- Concerning the Gospel message, Paul said,"...*so we preach and so you **<u>believed</u>***."

##### 1. Because Christ died for our sins and rose again just as God's Word says, we do not **<u>preach</u>** any other message to the unsaved for salvation. Romans 6:23

##### 2. Many modern-day Gospel presentations **<u>lack</u>** the central underlying message of the Gospel, which is the person and work of Christ.1 Corinthians 1:23,2:2; Galatians 6:14

##### 3. If the Gospel we preach does not contain the **<u>core</u>** issues outlined in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, we are not preaching the **true** Gospel as presented in the New Testament.

##### 4. Likewise, if the Gospel message we preach contains additions to Christ's person and work we are not faithfully preaching the **<u>Gospel</u>** of Christ.

## B.**Colossians 1:7-8 -- Epaphras: An interlude in Paul's prayer**

### 1. Colossians 1:7a --*Just as you **<u>learned</u>** it from Epaphras*. Epaphras was God's witness who was the first to preach the Gospel of grace to the Colossians. Epaphras was part of the Colossian church. Colossians 4:12, Philemon 23

### 2. Colossians 1:7b -- Paul spoke of Epaphras as ...*our beloved fellow bondservant*. Paul testified that he had a loving companion and trustworthy **<u>fellow</u>** laborer in the person of Epaphras.

### 3. Colossians 1:7c --*Who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf*... Epaphras ministered on behalf of Christ. By mentioning the faithfulness of Epaphras, Paul astutely encouraged following Epaphras' teachings and example as opposed to those who might **<u>not</u>** be *faithful servants **of Christ***.

### 4. Colossians 1:8 --*And he also informed us of your **<u>love</u>** in the Spirit.* Epaphras was the one who told Paul of the spiritual progress of the Colossians, specifically of their love produced by the Holy Spirit.

#### a. As mentioned in the introduction, this is the one and **<u>only</u>** reference to the Holy Spirit in the entire epistle.

#### b. In Colossians, Paul associated with **<u>Christ</u>** the activities he might normally associate with the Holy Spirit.(Compare Colossian 3:16 with Ephesians 5:18)

#### c. Paul may have made this shift in order to **exalt** Jesus Christ in the thinking of the Colossians and to correct a flawed viewpoint concerning the **<u>true</u>****source** of spirituality. This fact would help them appreciate and depend on both the authority and adequacy of Christ.

## C.**Colossians 1:9-12 -- Part two: Paul's prayer for their continuing maturity**

### 1. Colossians 1:9 -- The prayer of Paul and his companions was **<u>full</u>** of heartfelt concern for the well-being of the Colossians.

#### a. Colossians 1:9a --*For this reason, since the **<u>day</u>** we heard of it...* Paul pointed out that they began to pray for the Colossians from the day they first got news of their salvation.

#### b. Colossians 1:9b --*We have not ceased to **<u>pray</u>**...* Paul and his companions were persistent in their prayers, consistently remembering the Colossians right up to the present day.

##### 1. The phrase *not cease* EU PAUOMETHA literally means to do something without taking a **<u>rest</u>**, or pausing.

##### 2. Paul prayed because he knew that God is able to do in a believer's life *far more abundantly **<u>beyond</u>** all that we ask or think*. Ephesians 3:14-21

##### 3. Consistency in **<u>prayer</u>** is as important as consistency in teaching. Like Paul, we should dedicate ourselves to intercession for God's people.

#### c. Colossians 1:9c --*We have not ceased to pray **for you**...* The apostle's genuine concern for the Colossian believers can be seen in the **<u>two</u>** intimate words *for you*.

#### d. Colossians 1:9d --*We have not ceased to pray for you **and to ask**...* To ask AITEO means to **<u>beg</u>**, or intensely plead, on someone's behalf. We see Paul and his prayer companions imploring God to respond to their requests.

### 2. Colossians 1:9 --*To pray for you and to ask...* We will now focus in on the **<u>heart</u>** of Paul's petition for the Colossians. What was the central request of his prayer?

#### a. Colossians 1:9e -- Paul prayed *that \[they\] may be filled with the knowledge* of God's will. Paul wanted God to abundantly **<u>fill</u>** the Colossians with a precise kind of knowledge.

##### 1. The verb *filled* PLEROO conveys the idea of being filled all the way to the **<u>top</u>**, even to the point of overflowing.

##### 2. This verb PLEROO is in the passive voice meaning it would be someone else -- God in this case -- who would **<u>do</u>** the filling.

##### 3. Paul prayed that **<u>God</u>** would completely fill the Colossian believers with *knowledge*.

###### a. The Greek word for *knowledge* EPIGNOSIS is made up of the preposition EPI meaning **<u>apt</u>** or fitting and the common verb GNOSIS *knowledge*. This word therefore describes experiential or firsthand knowledge and entails discernment, recognition or perception.

###### b. When Paul prayed that God would give them **<u>all</u>** the same knowledge EPIGNOSIS, he was giving an indirect rebuke to false teachers who claimed to have secret knowledge, unknowable to the average person.

###### c. Interestingly, the words **mystery** MUSTERION (Col.1:26-27,2:2,4:3),**knowledge** GNOSIS, EPIGNOSIS (Col.1:9-10,2:2,3:10), and **fullness** PLEROMA (Col.1:19,2:10) were all extensively used by Gnostics who taught that **they****alone** had the **<u>full</u>** understanding of mysteries.

#### b. Colossians 1:9f -- Paul specifically prayed for the Colossians to be *filled with the knowledge **of God's [will</u>***.

##### 1. Paul labored to help believers understand God's will for them -- the **<u>mystery</u>** not revealed in past dispensations.1 Corinthians 2:7, Ephesians 3:9, Colossians 1:26

##### 2. Paul understood the immense **<u>value</u>** of intercession. Even though Paul sought to explain God's truth clearly, he knew the only way for the Colossians to understand God's will was for God to teach them.1 Corinthians 3:6

##### 3. From Paul's example, we should learn not only the importance of **<u>prayer</u>** but also what should be the content of our prayers for other believers. Ephesians 1:16-19,3:14-21

#### c. Colossians 1:9g -- Paul specifically prayed the Colossian believers would be filled with an understanding of God's will *in all spiritual **<u>wisdom</u>***.

##### 1. Spiritual wisdom can **<u>only</u>** be understood by the believer who is taught by God's Spirit.1 Corinthians 2:6-14

##### 2. An unsaved person cannot understand God's **<u>ways</u>**.1 Corinthians 2:14

##### 3.1 Corinthians 2:6-7a --*Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are **<u>mature</u>**; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God's wisdom*...

#### d. Colossians 1:9h -- Paul also prayed for the Colossian believers to be **<u>filled</u>** with the knowledge of God's will in all spiritual *...understanding*.

##### 1. The word *understanding* SUNESIS in Greek literally **<u>means</u>** a running together or a flowing together, like the joining of two rivers. The word denotes the ability to understand concepts and see relationships between them.

##### 2. To *understand* God's will is a process of properly combining the knowledge of the Word of God with **<u>real</u>**-life experience. Since this process must be divinely initiated, Paul correctly made this a second aspect of his petition for the Colossians. John 14:26,1 Corinthians 2:12, Ephesians 1:17-18

##### 3.1 Corinthians 3:6-7 --*I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. So then neither the one who plants nor the one who water is anything, but God who **<u>causes</u>** the growth*. Colossians 2:19b

##### 4. Acquiring spiritual *understanding***<u>guards</u>** you against reliving the first year of your Christian life for the twentieth time. James 1:21-25

### 3. Colossians 1:10-11 -- Being filled with the knowledge of God's will *in all spiritual wisdom and understanding* produces amazing **<u>results</u>**. Paul told the Colossians what they could expect in answer to his prayer.

#### a. Colossians 1:10a --...*to walk in a manner **<u>worthy</u>** of the Lord*. The first blessing that would flow from knowing God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding would be a changed walk.

##### 1.*To walk in a manner worthy of the Lord* means that their lives would be a **<u>tribute</u>** to the Lord and His amazing grace.1 Corinthians 15:10, Ephesians 2:7

##### 2. Paul knew that if the Colossian believers were filled with the knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding they would inevitably **<u>walk</u>**, or live their lives, in a way that gave credit to God's name. Titus 2:5b

#### b. Colossians 1:10b --*...to please Him in all respects*... If they were *filled with the knowledge of God's will*, the Colossian believers would be able to live a **<u>life</u>** completely pleasing to God.

##### 1. This amplifies the previous statement of walking in a worthy manner. The outcome of a worthy walk is a life that **<u>pleases</u>** the Father.

##### 2.**<u>Jesus</u>** fully pleased the Father as seen in the statement,"*This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased*." Paul prayed for the Colossians because he wanted them also to be pleasing to their God.

#### c. Colossians 1:10c --*Bearing fruit in every good work*... Knowing God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding would enable to the Colossians to **<u>bear</u>** fruit in the good works God had for each of them. Ephesians 2:10, Titus 2:14

##### 1. A natural outcome of a worthy **<u>walk</u>** is fruit-bearing. It was not Paul's desire that they simply do good works; Paul wanted their good works to be fruitful.

##### 2. This verse implies that **<u>not</u>** all good works are fruitful. How can that be? If good works are done in a believer's own strength, they are valueless and will not be recompensed at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Romans 7:18,24; 2 Corinthians 5:9-11; 2 Peter 1:8-10

###### a. Philippians 1:9 --*And this I **<u>pray</u>**, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment...* Paul prayed for the love of the Philippians to be based in *real knowledge* and *all discernment* AISTHESIS, meaning insight and full comprehension.

###### b. Philippians 1:10 -- He prayed this *so that \[they might\] approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ.*" In order to **<u>please</u>** God, the Philippians needed to first have the knowledge and discernment of God's will.

###### c. Philippians 1:11 --...*having been filled with the fruit of righteousness, which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God*. Ultimately though, the **<u>fruit</u>** of righteousness would be the product of Christ living His life through them as they walked by faith in Him. John 15:4-5; Galatians 2:20,5:22

##### 3. The good deeds which will be rewarded are those produced through us by Jesus Christ as we **<u>walk</u>** by faith.1 Corinthians 3:12-13,15:10; 2 Corinthians 4:7; Ephesians 3:16-17; Philippians 2:12-15; Hebrews 13:21

#### d. Colossians 1:10d -- As God answered Paul's prayer for the Colossians to be filled with the knowledge of God's will, they would be *increasing in the knowledge* EPIGNOSIS *of **<u>God</u>***.

##### 1. A growing knowledge of God is essential for **<u>life</u>**. The more you know God the less you depend on other things. Galatians 4:9

##### 2. This speaks of **<u>more</u>** than mere intellectual knowledge of God and His attributes, although our knowledge must start there. This involves firsthand knowledge of God gained by learning to daily lean on His Word in the midst of trials and tribulations. Psalm 9:10, John 17:3,1 John 2:13

#### e. Colossians 1:11a -- As a **<u>result</u>** of the Colossians being filled with the knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding they would also be *strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might*.2 Peter 1:3-4

##### 1. Through knowing God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding we learn that He has provided for us *His glorious **<u>might</u>***. Ephesians 1:18-19

##### 2. God is not looking for inherently **<u>strong</u>** believers. He is looking for humbly dependent believers. A weak believer quickly learns to rely on God's strength, while a supposedly strong believer falls prey to self-sufficient arrogance.1 Corinthians 10:12; 2 Corinthians 2:3-5,12:9-10

#### f. Colossians 1:11b -- As a result of being filled with the knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding the Colossian believers would ultimately grow to the point of *attaining of **<u>all</u>** steadfastness and patience*.

##### 1. Steadfastness HYPOMONEN means to endure **<u>under</u>** trials or to bear up under difficulties. This kind of stamina comes only through our knowledge of God's plan and will for us in Christ. Therefore, stamina comes through the knowledge of what we have in Christ and who Christ is for our sake.

##### 2. Though similar concepts, the difference between *steadfastness* and *patience* is that while *steadfastness* has to do with bearing up under trials,*patience* MAKROTHYMIAN has to do with **<u>long</u>**-term endurance in trials. Romans 5:3-5, James 1:2-4

##### 3. Clearly, the Colossians needed God's glorious **<u>strength</u>** to be able to patiently and steadfastly persevere under hardship. Ephesians 3:16, Philippians 4:13

##### 4. We should **<u>grow</u>** in our understanding of God's will to the point that we joyfully weather every trial, although in the end it is Christ who gives us stamina and ultimately gets all the glory.2 Corinthians 3:4-6

## D.**Colossians 1:12-14 -- Part three: Paul's prayer of worship**

### 1. Colossians 1:11c-12a --*Joyously **<u>giving</u>** thanks to the Father*... If God would answer Paul's prayer for the Colossian believers to be filled with the knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, the Colossians would truly have **<u>reason</u>** to rejoice and be thankful.

#### a. Paul prayed with the high hopes that the Colossians would joyfully and continually give thanks*.* Clearly this only occurs when one is occupied with **<u>Christ</u>**, living dependently on Him. Colossians 3:15-16, Hebrews 12:1-2

#### b. When a believer is unthankful, something is wrong with his understanding. Maybe he doesn't know the truth, remember the truth, appreciate the truth or is proudly choosing to ignore it, but whatever the case, he will be **<u>bitter</u>**.

### 2. Colossians 1:12b --*Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us*... Paul's prayer continued with **<u>praise</u>** to God for their (our) future blessings in Christ.

#### a. Colossians 1:12b -- Paul rejoiced because our heavenly **<u>Father</u>** has already ...*qualified us to share in the inheritance.*

##### 1. As believers, we **<u>share</u>** in Christ's inheritance. Through our salvation we became co-heirs with Christ. Romans 8:17

##### 2. Based upon the aorist tense of the verb *qualified* HIKANOO (made us fit), this is something God has already accomplished at a point in time in the **<u>past</u>**. As saints, our qualification to inherit is a done deal. This is an issue that God has intentionally taken upon Himself to provide for every believer.

##### 3. Thankfully, according to this verse, God,**<u>not</u>** YOU, is the guarantor of your future inheritance. You will **never** be qualified for it based on your own merits. Your inheritance is not something you earn by good behavior. Hebrews 9:15,1 Peter 1:4

##### 4. The Holy **<u>Spirit</u>** who lives in every believer is God's guarantee of future participation in the inheritance. Ephesians 1:13-14

##### 5. The promise of a future inheritance for the believer is just as secure as our future hope of eternal **<u>life</u>**. They go hand in hand. Amazingly, God is the one who prequalified us to share in the inheritance and He did so on the day of our salvation. Titus 3:7

#### b. Colossians 1:12c -- Paul praised God for the future *inheritance **of the saints in Light***. This means that just as we once owned a portion of the kingdom of darkness, now as believers we possess a portion in the soon-to-come kingdom of **<u>light</u>**. Acts 26:18, Ephesians 5:8

##### 1. In His foreknowledge, God predestined all who **<u>believe</u>** in Christ to have a part in His inheritance. Romans 8:28-30, Ephesians 1:11,18

##### 2. The phrase *in light* speaks of our glorification and **<u>future</u>** participation in God's eternal kingdom.1 Peter 1:3-8, Revelation 22:5

#### c.1 Peter 1:4 -- As saints and **<u>children</u>** of God, we have an inheritance that is permanent.

##### 1. This verse marks a clear distinction between heaven and our inheritance. According to this verse, heaven is not our inheritance, rather heaven is the bank where our inheritance is **<u>kept</u>**.

###### a. On this earth, people can die before they get their inheritance. Or their inheritance can be stolen, lost, burned, corrupted, etc., but in heaven there is no **<u>fear</u>** of losing your inheritance.

###### b. Peter stated that our inheritance is guaranteed for us in our promised heavenly home. It is safe and secure and never merited, not even on our best day. It cannot be **<u>lost</u>**.

##### 2. In this verse, Peter made several adamant declarations concerning the certainty of our **<u>future</u>** participation in Christ's inheritance in heaven.

###### a. We have an *imperishable* inheritance. Being everlasting, our inheritance can **<u>never</u>** be destroyed.

###### b. We have an *undefiled* inheritance. Our inheritance can never be **<u>spoiled</u>**.

###### c. We have an *unfading* inheritance. Our inheritance will never diminish or lose its **<u>beauty</u>**.

###### d. We have an inheritance that is *reserved in **<u>heaven</u>** for*\[us\]*.* Our inheritance is permanently earmarked for us, being guarded for us by God in heaven.

### 3. Colossians 1:13 -- Paul continued his praise to God in prayer for their **<u>earlier</u>** deliverance in Christ (justification).

#### a. Colossians 1:13a -- God rescued us from grave **<u>peril</u>**.*For He delivered us from the domain of darkness,* from Satan's power and jurisdiction. Colossians 2:15

##### 1. Paul **<u>used</u>** the middle, or reflexive, voice for the verb *delivered*, communicating an intimacy and compassion.

##### 2. The grammar communicates a snatching or rescuing from danger with the goal of drawing the one saved **<u>under</u>** one's personal care.

#### b. Colossians 1:13b -- Paul also praised God for their future inclusion in His eternal plan saying,"A*nd*\[He\]*transferred us to the **<u>kingdom</u>** of His beloved Son.*" This statement is a reality to be accepted by faith and not an experience to be felt.

##### 1. This word *transferred* METHISTEMI was used to describe the relocation of large **<u>groups</u>** of people such as captured armies or refugees from one country to another.

##### 2. History records that the Greek ruler Antiochus the Great, the sixth ruler of the Seleucid Empire who ruled from BC 222 to BC 187,*transferred* METHISTEMI (same word, conveyed or transported) some 2,000 **<u>Jews</u>** from Babylon to Colossae.

##### 3. This is a beautiful description of our position **<u>change</u>** as believers. God removed us from being *in Adam* and placed us *in Christ*. This is part of our inheritance as saints.1Corinthians 12:22, Ephesians 2:1-6

### 4. Colossians 1:14 -- Paul **<u>ended</u>** his prayer of praise with a declaration of our gracious position as blameless. Ephesians 1:4,7

#### a. Colossians 1:14a --*In whom we have redemption*... Paul burst forth in praise for the **<u>price</u>** Christ paid to purchase our spiritual freedom.

##### 1. Remarkably, this is the current possession of **<u>every</u>** believer in Christ. Notice that we have this redemption *in Him*, in Christ.

##### 2. In the here and now, as a result of our union with Christ, we have been redeemed. By paying the required price, Christ purchased us out of the **<u>slave</u>** market of sin.

##### 3. This is not a blessing we obtained because of something we did or must do, rather it is ours through the pure **<u>grace</u>** of God.

#### b. Colossians 1:14b --...*in whom we have redemption,**the forgiveness of sins***... Along with the apostle Paul, we should rejoice in praise and thanksgiving for the remission of our **<u>sins</u>** because of Christ's death on our behalf.

##### 1. Because the penalty for sin has been paid in **<u>full</u>** on our behalf, God was able to forgive us eternally for all our sins.

##### 2. Although the phrase "ask for forgiveness" is a very popular phrase in modern evangelism, it is not a biblical requirement for salvation. If you could be forgiven by simply asking for forgiveness, then **<u>Christ</u>** died needlessly.

##### 3. When a person trusts in Christ, God recognizes Christ's death as his or her substitute. God is therefore **<u>free</u>** to forgive without any pleading by the sinner since the sin penalty was already paid in full at Calvary.

# III.**Colossians 1:15-18 -- God's Protection From Heresies: Understanding the Sovereign Authority of Christ**

## A.**Introduction: Attacks on the deity of Christ**

### 1. Philosophy: This error, referred to in Colossians 2:8, emphasizes following human philosophy and secular knowledge. It deceives **<u>believers</u>** into thinking that Christ is insufficient and therefore they need to figure out life by means of philosophy.

#### a. Life based on philosophy places secular **<u>logic</u>** and human reasoning over and above a living, breathing relationship with Christ as found in Scripture.

#### b. Solomon, the wisest human (other than Jesus Christ) to ever live (wiser than Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Buddha, Confucius, etc.), came to the conclusion that human philosophies and ideologies **<u>fall</u>** miserably short of giving meaning to life. Ecclesiastes 1:2-3

#### c. Christ stated that He is the only **<u>way</u>**, truth and life. Peter added that all we need for life and godliness is found in the true knowledge of Christ.2 Peter 1:3

#### d. Paul revealed in Colossians 1:27 that the mystery of life is *Christ **<u>in</u>** you*. Colossians 2:2-3 further illustrates this truth.

### 2. Legalism: Colossians 2:16-17 portrays a blending of ritualism and law with the truth of Christ. This error produces a **<u>works</u>**-based Christianity that becomes nothing more than an oppressive system of legalism. Acts 15:1-11

#### a. This **<u>error</u>** trades fellowship with Christ for legalistic regulations and religious rituals. Many churches fall into the trap of believing that godliness can be obtained by fulfilling rules and doing rituals rather than through a vibrant, faith-based relationship with Christ. Philippians 3:9

#### b. When Christians are bound up in this error, they are typically characterized by rigidity, intolerance, self-righteousness and pride rather than by **<u>humble</u>** authenticity.

#### c. Down through the centuries, this deviation has turned believers to things that are merely symbols of Christ but devoid of Christ Himself. You might say believers have focused on the **<u>shadow</u>** rather than the substance, or on the reflection rather than the reality. Colossians 2:17

### 3. Mysticism: Colossians 2:18 points out the error of *spiritual mysticism*. This error attracts believers to **<u>focus</u>** on experiences and opens them to exploitation by deceitful leaders.

#### a. This error enchants Christians by the fantastic, the inexplicable and the supernatural. It **<u>trades</u>** the authenticity of a faith-based fellowship with Christ for a "Christianity" based on so-called signs, mystical experiences and spiritual exploits.

#### b. This deviation exalts the mystical. It often humiliates its adherents by foolish requirements. Sometimes it promotes a fixation on spirit beings, whether angels or demons. It boasts in **<u>dreams</u>** and visions (prophesies).

#### c. This digression prefers miracles to the **<u>Master</u>** and seeks the gifts over the Giver.

### 4. Asceticism: Colossians 2:20-23 describes a Christianity based on **<u>human</u>** determination through the practice of *asceticism*.

#### a. This error advocates the so-called spiritual disciplines and promotes self-denial as the **<u>key</u>** to godliness. It exchanges a sincere dependence on Christ with rigid self-determination.

#### b. Instead of pointing people to a consistent walk of **<u>faith</u>** in order to live the abundant life, this error wrongly requires believers to try to better themselves through human effort and self-reliance.

#### c. This error detaches the believer from Christ, who is the true head of the church. It promotes reliance on human efforts rather than on the **<u>Christ</u>**.

### 5. In a study of church history, we find that *Gnosticism* ultimately developed from a **<u>mixture</u>** of all these false concepts. Unfortunately, we are not out of danger today. These heresies continue to daily assault the church.

#### a. According to history, during the second and third centuries after Christ, Gnostics, in one **<u>form</u>** or another, embraced and promoted these deviations.

#### b. We need to realize that the Colossian heresies remain a constant threat to Christianity. One or more of these areas have almost certainly affected every modern believer. Growth as a believer comes when God convinces us that **<u>Christ</u>** is all we need and He has all the answers.

### 6. So what do all these **<u>errors</u>** have in common?

#### a. Each error gives a perfunctory allegiance to Christ but does not promote total dependence on His adequacy. Each one is first and foremost an affront to Christ's sufficiency for **<u>living</u>** the abundant life.

#### b. In all these errors the Christian is duped into living by human effort rather than *by **<u>faith</u>** in the Son of God who loved us and gave himself up for us*. Galatians 2:20b

#### c. Ultimately these errors **<u>demean</u>** Christ's sufficiency and lead to the false notion that Christ is not enough. We easily become like Esau and sell our birthright for a bowl of porridge.

## B. Colossians 1:15-18 -- Articulating the deity of Christ

### 1. Colossians 1:15 -- As God-made-visible, Jesus Christ holds **<u>first</u>** place in all creation.

#### a. Colossians 1:15a --***He is** the image of the invisible God*... He is the greatest person to **<u>ever</u>** emerge in human history.2 Corinthians 4:4

##### 1. In the incarnation, Jesus **<u>came</u>** in God's likeness. Jesus is both from God and God at the same time. John 1:1-2,14; Galatians 4:4; 1 Timothy 6:16

##### 2. Since Christ is **<u>God</u>**, He was able to become the revelation of God to mankind. John 6:46, John 14:8-10

##### 3. Christ is the visible manifestation of the invisible God. Absolutely **<u>no</u>** one else can validly make this claim. John 1:18

#### b. Colossians 1:15b --*He is the **image** of the invisible God*... Christ is the **<u>exact</u>** exemplification of God the Father. Hebrews 1:3

##### 1. Adam was created in God's image and likeness. Even **<u>after</u>** the fall, He continued to somewhat reflect God's likeness, yet only Christ is the exact representation of God. Genesis 9:6,1 Corinthians 11:7

##### 2. Christ is the express **<u>image</u>** EIKON of the invisible God.

###### a. This word *image* EIKON was used of Caesar's image on currency (Lk.20:24-25) and of idols representing men,**<u>birds</u>** and other animals. Romans 1:23

###### b. A photographic **<u>copy</u>** of a document would be a modern illustration of this word. A photographic copy of a document becomes the exact representation (image) of the original document.

#### c. Colossians 1:15c --*He is the image of the **invisible God***. Why was this statement about God being invisible significant, especially to the Colossian believers?

##### 1. The point made in this verse was **<u>aimed</u>** directly at heresy. Church history shows that as the heresies of chapter two advanced, Jesus Christ came to be viewed as one of many emanations of God. Christ was seen as a mere stepping-stone in a multilevel progression toward God.

##### 2. If Jesus Christ is indeed the visible manifestation of the invisible God, we can come to know God by simply getting to **<u>know</u>** Jesus. There are no steps needed and nothing is hidden in this process.

### 2. Colossians 1:15 -- Jesus Christ holds first place as the **<u>premier</u>** human of all time.

#### a. Colossians 1:15d --*The **firstborn** of all creation...* The word *firstborn* PROTOTOKOS in Greek means first in order or rank. Even though the word PROTOTOKOS can mean the firstborn in **<u>birth</u>** order in a family, it is not restricted to that meaning.

##### 1. Historically a sibling **<u>other</u>** than the firstborn would oftentimes carry the title of *firstborn* PROTOTOKOS.

##### 2. Adam might seem to have originally deserved that **<u>title</u>** because of his position in human history, yet Christ eternally predated him and has far superseded him as God's firstborn PROTOTOKOS among humans.

#### b. Colossians 1:15e --*The firstborn **of all** creation...* means that He is the greatest man to **<u>emerge</u>** in human history.

##### 1. This does **<u>not</u>** mean that the Father created Christ. John 1:1-3

##### 2. Jesus Christ is called the firstborn of all creation because He **<u>holds</u>** the premier position of first place among humankind. Acts 4:12,1 Timothy 2:5

#### c. Colossians 1:15f --*The firstborn of all **creation***... Jesus Christ is fully **<u>man</u>**. The significance of the statement that Jesus Christ is *the firstborn of all creation* demonstrates that He alone is God's preeminent man in human history. Only He holds this honor. Romans 1:3-4

### 3. Colossians 1:16-17 -- Jesus Christ holds the **<u>place</u>** of greatest honor on earth because He is the Creator of everything.

#### a. Colossians 1:16 --*For **<u>by</u>** Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible*... Our reaction to this statement might be,"Wait a minute? I thought God created the heavens and the earth."(Gen.1:1) If that is how you react, Paul succeeded in his statement. John 1:3

##### 1. Colossians 1:16a -- Jesus Christ is the originator of **<u>all</u>** creation....*by*(EN, denoting instrumentality)*him all things were created.*

###### a. This verse begins with *...for by Him* HOTI EN AUTO (Col 1:16), a phrase that expresses **<u>cause</u>** or purpose. It can be understood as **because in Him**.

###### b. In other words, this verse gives us the reasons why Jesus Christ came to **<u>merit</u>** the designation of firstborn PROTOTOKOS of all creation.

##### 2. Colossians 1:16b --*For by Him all things were created **both in the heavens and on earth***... Christ personally designed and **<u>made</u>** the entire universe.

##### 3. Colossians 1:16c --*For by Him all things were created*...***visible and invisible***... He made everything in both the material and immaterial **<u>realms</u>**.

##### 4. Colossians 1:16d --*For by Him all things were created*...***whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities***... Christ is the one who created all the hierarchy of **<u>spirit</u>** beings in the celestial realms as well as all human authorities.

###### a. Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Paul's point is to show Christ's **<u>place</u>** in the universe as Creator and owner, supreme above everything. He is over the unseen realms of angels and demons and the visible realms of humankind.

###### b. Although Jesus Christ created spirit beings and their hierarchical chain of command, He is not a part of that structure. As Creator, He is **<u>above</u>** all hierarchy.

###### c. So did Christ create demons? No, He created holy and pure angels who **<u>became</u>** evil and sinful when they willfully followed Satan in his rebellion. Even so, their hierarchical chain of authority remained intact. It did not change even in their sinful rebellion.

#### b. Colossians 1:16 --*All things were created through* DIA *Him.* Jesus Christ is the **prime [source</u>** of every created thing. Hebrews 1:2

##### 1. Colossians 1:16e --*...__all__ things...* The word *all* PANTA is a comprehensive word used twice in this verse, clearly indicating that absolutely **nothing** in all Creation was created or ever existed __<u>without</u>__ Jesus Christ.

##### 2. Colossians 1:16f --*...were created...* In Greek, the verb *were created* KTIZO is an aorist passive indicative verb that indicates these things did not create themselves or **<u>form</u>** on their own, i.e., evolution. An outside force acting upon them created them. Jesus Christ decisively created everything.

##### 3. Colossians 1:16g --*...**through** Him...* Creation remains a testimony and proof of Christ's monumental creative might. Nothing was created in any **<u>other</u>** way or through any other means than *through* Jesus Christ.

#### c. Colossians 1:16 -- Jesus Christ is the **prime [purpose</u>** behind all creation.

##### 1. Colossians 1:16h --*...all things were created...**for** Him*...*For* EIS is a preposition that conveys purpose or **<u>goal</u>**.

##### 2. Colossians 1:16i --*...all things were created... for **Him***. Everything was created to be Christ's **<u>own</u>** possession and for His own good pleasure. Creation's ultimate purpose for existing can be found in the holy, just and perfect counsels of its Creator Jesus Christ. Romans 11:36, Revelation 4:11

#### d. Colossians 1:17 --*He is **<u>before</u>** all things...* Jesus Christ is the **prime precursor** of everything. He existed eternally before Creation was initiated. John 1:3

##### 1. Colossians 1:17a --***<u>He</u>** is before all things*... Because of the grammatical placement of the pronoun *He*, this phrase could be understood as "He and no other." John 8:58

##### 2. Colossians 1:17b --*He **is** before all things...* We should note the use of the present tense word *is* in this verse in contrast to the past tense was. He is (not **<u>was</u>**) before all things. This accentuates the fact that Jesus Christ, as eternal God, always was and always **is** and always will be before all things.

#### e. Colossians 1:17 --*...and in Him all things **<u>hold</u>** together*. Jesus Christ is the **prime supporter** of all creation.

##### 1. The thought of this verse progresses beyond the creation of all things to the preservation of all things. By implication,**<u>without</u>** Christ everything would simply disintegrate. Acts 17:28, Hebrews 1:3

##### 2. This verse indicates that Jesus Christ is not distant or detached from His creation. He is intimately involved in even the minutest affairs of this **<u>life</u>**, including the cares of every individual. Psalm 139:1-18, Luke 12:6-7

### 4. Colossians 1:18 --*He is also head of the body, the church*... Christ holds first place of honor **TO US** because He is the **<u>head</u>** of the church.

#### a. Colossians 1:18a -- Note that ***He is [head</u>** of the body*, not ***a*** head of the body.

##### 1. There is no authority in the body of Christ that is greater or can ever take the **<u>place</u>** of Jesus Christ. Ephesians 1:22-23

##### 2. Although the pastor and elders of a local body deserve respect, they are not head of the church; they are **<u>under</u>** the headship of Christ.1 Timothy 5:17,19,1 Peter 5:1-5

##### 3. There are Christian groups that claim that their leader holds the place of Christ (Christ's vicar). This is an **<u>insult</u>** to Jesus Christ. Colossians 2:18-19

#### b. Colossians 1:18b --*He is head **of the body**...* Christ alone is the head of His body, the church. Revelation 19:7

##### 1. Christ is the head of His body, which is one **<u>single</u>** body made up of all Christians.1 Corinthians 12:12-13, Ephesians 4:15

##### 2. In the human body, the body responds to the leading of the **<u>head</u>**. Colossians 2:19

##### 3. When the head is not able to correctly **<u>control</u>** the body, the body becomes dysfunctional or paralyzed, indicating serious disease or injury. This is true of Christ's body as well.

#### c. Colossians 1:18c --*He is also head of the body,**the church**...* Christ is **<u>first</u>** in the church. Ephesians 1:22

##### 1. Whether it is accepted or acknowledged, Jesus Christ is number **<u>one</u>** in His church. The church ought therefore to respond to Him exclusively.

##### 2. Christ holds the **<u>final</u>** word of authority in regards to His body and bride. He alone maintains the ultimate right to decide if His church will continue to exist in a community or not. Revelation 2-3

### 5. Colossians 1:18 --...*and He is the beginning*... Jesus Christ **<u>holds</u>** first place as the *beginning*.

#### a. This is **<u>not</u>** saying Christ appeared in the beginning, rather that He is the initiator of everything that exists.

#### b. It is one thing to be the first one created, but quite another to be the source and reason for the existence of everything. Christ is the **<u>source</u>** of all substance ...*for without him nothing came into being that has come into being*... John 1:3

#### c. If you rewind the reels of history, you will arrive right at the feet of Christ. He is the **<u>author</u>** and Creator of all that exists.

### 6. Colossians 1:18c --...*the firstborn from the dead*... Jesus Christ holds first place as the firstborn PROTOTOKOS from among the **<u>dead</u>**. Acts 2:24

#### a. Christ was the first human being to **<u>rise</u>** from the dead **never to die again**.1 Corinthians 15:20

#### b. Quite simply, Christ is the first person to ever fully **<u>conquer</u>** death. Romans 6:9

#### c. Christ did something no other person has ever done. He was not merely resuscitated; He came back from death to **<u>never</u>** again face death. Romans 6:10

#### d. Death's defiant **<u>womb</u>** gave birth to a firstborn, Jesus Christ. The word firstborn conveys the anticipating of more births to follow. Romans 6:5,8; Revelation 1:5

##### 1. Because He is the firstborn, the implication is that there is a new **<u>family</u>**. In fact, He was the start of a new humanity, the firstborn of the new creation.2 Corinthians 5:17, Hebrews 2:9-10, James 1:18

##### 2. It is because Jesus Christ conquered death and rose again that we have the confident expectation (**<u>hope</u>**) that He can and will also raise us up from the dead in the future. Acts 3:15, Romans 6:4-5

### 7. Colossians 1:18d -- A summary statement: ...*that He Himself might come to **<u>have</u>****first place in everything***. Our Savior Jesus Christ holds first place in everything.

#### a. The word ...*that*... in this phrase is a HINA clause, or a clause of purpose. This clause in Greek informed the readers that everything previously mentioned in verses 15-18 was mentioned for the purpose of showing Christ's authority -- that He holds the highest possible **<u>rank</u>** in every realm.

#### b.**How often** should Christ *have first place* in your life? Since ***first place*** PROTEUO is a present tense, active voice participle the answer would be,"**<u>Always</u>**, continually, and right now."

#### c. In **how many areas** should Christ *have first place*? "*In **<u>everything</u>***!"

# IV. Colossians 1:19-29 -- God's Protection from Heresies: Understanding the Adequacy of Christ

## A.**Colossians 1:19-23 -- The adequacy of Christ in His work of reconciliation**

### 1. Colossians 1:19 -- The wisdom of God in His choice of **<u>Christ</u>** can be seen in this sentence: *For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness* PLEROMA *to dwell in Him*.

#### a. It was totally pleasing to the Father to have *all the fullness **<u>dwell</u>** in* Christ.

##### 1. What this means practically for you is that you do **<u>not</u>** have to go on a quest outside of Christ to find life's answers. Colossians 2:10

##### 2. Everything you need for **<u>godly</u>** living is found in the person of Christ.2 Peter 1:2-4

#### b. Virtually all religions around the world claim to have completeness, or full knowledge, yet true fullness is found only in Jesus Christ. Everything necessary for understanding life **<u>dwells</u>** in Christ.2 Peter 3:18

##### 1. In **<u>Gnostic</u>** writings the concept of *fullness* referred to a complex series of angelic emanations that were portrayed as levels of mediation between God and man.1 Timothy 2:5

##### 2. Jesus, being **<u>fully</u>** God, expressed all the fullness of God in His human body; therefore, if a person has Christ as Savior there is no need for any supposed mediating agents, e.g., angels or prayers to Mary and/or to other departed saints.

##### 3. Throughout the world and throughout history, the majority of **<u>cults</u>** have rejected in some way or another the adequacy of Christ (His fullness), saying you need something other than, or in addition to, Christ. Matthew 11:27

#### c. Jesus Christ is the only human who has ever existed who could answer **<u>all</u>** life\'s questions. You do not need to look beyond Him to make sense of life. Christ is truly all you need.

### 2. Colossians 1:20 -- The indescribable task of reconciling **<u>sinful</u>** mankind and a ruined creation to God the Father was given to Christ.

#### a. Colossians 1:20a --*And through Him to reconcile **all things** to Himself...* There is only one person who is **<u>able</u>** to reconcile all of creation back to God and that is the man Christ Jesus.1 Corinthians 15:20-28

##### 1. The ultimate **<u>goal</u>** in reconciliation is to bring about a complete restoration of man with his Creator God.1 Timothy 2:5-6

###### a. Back in the Garden of Eden humanity became God's **<u>enemy</u>** through sin. Jesus' death for our sins and resurrection provided the means for us to be brought back into friendship with God.1 Peter 2:24-25

###### b. Even though **<u>mankind</u>** needs to be reconciled to God, when it comes to reconciliation, humanity has always been the problem. Man's sinful pride has kept him from being brought back to God. Romans 5:12,16

###### c. Although mankind is at **<u>fault</u>** for creating the enmity, God graciously solved the problem by providing Christ as an appeasing sacrifice.

##### 2. Reconciliation means that you completely **<u>switch</u>** from being an enemy to becoming a friend. Reconciliation creates true and lasting peace between former enemies. Romans 5:1,8:1; 2 Corinthians 5:18-20; Ephesians 2:16

##### 3. Since all human beings are at odds with God, each one of us needs reconciliation. Every human being is totally **<u>sinful</u>** and incapable of independently approaching the holy and sinless Creator. Romans 5:10, Ephesians 2:13-18

##### 4. Jesus Christ's substitutionary sacrificial death on the **<u>cross</u>** provided the only adequate means of being reunited with God. Man, by means of philosophy, religious works, mystical experiences or self-reformation can never achieve restoration with God. Colossians 1:20-22

##### 5. God desired that **<u>all</u>** creation be reconciled to Him and that is what Christ came to do through His death on the cross.

###### a. When this verse says God is reconciling all things to Himself through Christ it does not imply that all people will be **<u>saved</u>**.

###### b. The Bible never teaches universalism: the **<u>false</u>** belief that all people will be saved in the end. Revelation 20:11-15

###### c. But God does **<u>desire</u>** that all be saved, and He worked, and continues to work, toward that end.2 Corinthians 5:15,1 Timothy 2:4,1 Peter 3:18

#### b. Colossians 1:20b --*Having made peace through the **<u>blood</u> of His cross**...* Christ's death was a blood sacrifice that allowed for the reconciliation of all things to God. It could not be an animal, grain or oil sacrifice.

##### 1. In His death as a sacrifice, Christ did not die smothered, strangled or drowned; He **<u>died</u>** by means of the violent death of bloodshed in crucifixion. Matthew 26:28; Romans 3:25,5:9; Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:14

##### 2. Hebrews 9:22 --*And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of **<u>blood</u>** there is no forgiveness*. Leviticus 17:11

#### c. Colossians 1:20c --*And through Him to reconcile all things to Himself**...whether things on earth or things in **<u>heaven</u>***. This verse teaches that Christ was given the responsibility of the reconciling of *all things* to Himself. This includes earth with heaven (man with God), and heaven with earth (God with man). Romans 8:18-25

### 3. Colossians 1:21-23 -- The all-encompassing and sufficient nature of Christ's **<u>grace</u>** is seen in the Father's full confidence in the Son. The Father was pleased to entrust to the Son the responsibility of reconciling insubordinate humanity to Himself.

###### a. Colossians 1:21 -- In our former condition, because of our sin, we were outsiders and **<u>aliens</u>** to God.

##### 1. Colossians 1:21a --*And although you were formerly **alienated**...* Originally as enemies, we were estranged from **<u>God</u>**.

###### a.*Alienated* APALLOTRIOO in Greek is from APO which is a prefix emphasizing **separation** plus the word ALLOTRIOS, a verb meaning to **alienate**. We were completely alienated **<u>from</u>** God.

###### b. Our original **<u>state</u>** of alienation portrayed unfriendliness, hostility and unresponsiveness in relation to God.

##### 2. Colossians 1:21b --*You were formerly alienated and **hostile in mind**...* In our lost state, we **<u>were</u>** hostile enemies of God in our way of thinking.

###### a. The word *hostile* ECHTHROS means hateful,**<u>enemy</u>**, adversary or opponent.

###### b. As unbelievers, all our thoughts towards God were adversarial. This is the natural condition of **<u>lost</u>** humanity. Genesis 6:5-6, Jeremiah 17:9, Matthew 15:18-20, Ephesians 2:1-3

###### c. Even for the believer, sin starts *in*\[the\]***<u>mind</u>***. When we permit wrong thinking we become hostile toward God. Romans 8:7, Ephesians 4:17-19

##### 3. Colossians 1:21b --*Engaged in evil deeds...* In our former lifestyle we were **<u>evil</u>** in our conduct. We were separated from God not only in our evil thinking but also in our actions.

#### b. Colossians 1:22 -- Conversely, now in our **<u>new</u>** standing we have friendship with God.

##### 1. Colossians 1:22a --*Yet He has **<u>now</u>** reconciled you **in His fleshly body** through death...* While in His earthy body Christ reconciled us by means of death. Hebrews 10:10,19-20; 1 Peter 2:23-24,3:18

###### a. Paul stated the Colossian believers' reconciliation as a **<u>fact</u>** when he said,"*He has now reconciled you."**Now* is the word NUNI, meaning at this very moment.

###### b. Your reconciliation is an act of restoration that happened at a **<u>point</u>** in time, the moment you believed. Although you were alienated from God, at salvation you were permanently restored to your rightful owner. Romans 5:10

###### c. Your reconciliation is based on the sacrifice of Christ on the cross and happened at the precise moment you believed. It is not based on your good **<u>works</u>**. Colossians 1: 3-6,20

###### d. Since reconciliation is based on the work of Christ, it lasts forever. You are either reconciled or you are **<u>not</u>** reconciled. Your reconciliation does not depend on faithfulness after salvation. John 5:24,1 Peter 1:3-5

##### 2. Colossians 1:22b -- Christ reconciled us *...in His fleshly body through **<u>death</u>***. In His death on the cross, in his physical body, Christ won our reconciliation.1 Peter 2:24

###### a. It is interesting to note that here in this passage Paul pointed out that our reconciliation is based on the physical, bodily death of **<u>Christ</u>** on the cross and not merely on the spiritual aspect of Christ's death. Hebrews 9:28; 10:5,10

###### b. Gnostics propagated a **<u>heresy</u>** called Docetism, which proposed that Jesus Christ did not in reality have a material body. They hypothesized that He only seemed to have a material body and therefore the physical death of Christ had no value in our reconciliation.1 John 4:2,2 John 1:7

####### i. Based on this philosophy, the Gnostics wholly rejected the incarnation and Christ's literal **<u>physical</u>** death, as do many cults today. Acts 5:30

####### ii. The Gnostics based their heresy on a philosophy that all physical or material substances are inherently **<u>evil</u>**. Therefore they erroneously supposed that if Christ had had a physical body He would have been innately corrupt.

####### iii. The Gnostics wrongly concluded that Christ did not actually die physically since according to their belief He did not have a physical **<u>body</u>**. This heresy was of course an affront to the Gospel that includes the physical and spiritual death of Christ. John 1:14,1 Peter 3:18

###### c. In relation to the doctrines of salvation, we should be careful not to exaggerate or understate either the physical or spiritual aspects of Christ's **<u>death</u>** on the cross.

##### 3. Colossians 1:22c -- It was *in order to present you before him*... Christ had a specific **<u>purpose</u>** for us *in* time as well as in eternity when He saved us. He did not save us so that we would stay the same. He wanted to change us and make us holy in our daily lives. Romans 6:22,12:1-2; Ephesians 2:10; Titus 3:8

##### 4. Colossians 1:22d -- In saying,"*present you before him holy, blameless and beyond reproach*," Paul was speaking of spiritual **<u>growth</u>**, not glorification as this passage will bear out.

###### a. In our future glorification, holiness, blamelessness and being beyond reproach are guaranteed. These things will be true of every believer in **<u>heaven</u>**, but that is not what Paul was referring to here. Philippians 2:15

###### b. Christ saved us because He wanted to present us **<u>before</u>** the Father in maximum practical sanctification (second tense salvation) in time. This is one of His goals in reconciling us to God. Genesis 6:9, Luke 1:6,1 Thessalonians 2:10

##### 5. Colossians 1:22e --...*in order to present you **before Him** holy and blameless and beyond reproach*. Christ wants to **<u>present</u>** you in maximum practical sanctification (full maturity) before the Father in your daily walk.

###### a.*Before him* KATENOPION means before the **<u>face</u>** of, before the presence of, in the sight of, or before one as witness.2 Corinthians 2:17,4:2b; James 4:10

###### b. The idea of being on display *before him*(God) is sometimes used in the New Testament to describe God\'s view of us **<u>here</u>** and now on earth.2 Corinthians 12:19,1 Timothy 5:21,1 Thessalonians 4:3a, Hebrews 12:14,1 Peter 1:15-16, Jude 24

###### c. What this is saying is that God's ultimate goal in reconciling you to Himself is so that Christ can present you before God in maximum practical sanctification while you are still **<u>living</u>** this life. John 17:17; Ephesians 4:13,5:25-27; Philippians 3:12-15

####### i. This by no means describes or implies **<u>sinless</u>** perfection.

####### ii. The heresies that were developing in the Colossian church would have severely jeopardized the prospect of maximum practical sanctification in their **<u>daily</u>** lives (maturity).

####### iii. For this reason in verse 23, as we will see, Paul gave a condition to this goal, an "if" statement, to believers who were at risk of not becoming holy, blameless and beyond reproach in their daily living.

###### d. These three terms (*holy, blameless, and beyond reproach*) all relate to Christian **<u>maturity</u>** and our daily sanctification and not exclusively to our future glorification. Job 1:1, Hebrews 11:5

##### 6. Colossians 1:22f --*Present you before him **holy**, blameless and beyond reproach*... The adjective ***<u>holy</u>*** HAGIOS literally means different. Temples were described by this term, meaning they were not ordinary or mundane buildings. They were different in purpose and use.

###### a. The New Testament authors further developed the meaning of holy HAGIOS to describe **<u>both</u>** the **condition** and **position** of the believer. The context will indicate which is being referenced.1 Corinthians 1:2

###### b. Believers are to be separated from **<u>sin</u>** and set apart for God's specific use in time (Rom.6:22,2 Cor.7:1) and will ultimately be separated eternally from sin and set apart for God's specific use in future glory. Ephesians 5:25-27,1 Thessalonians 3:12-13

##### 7. Colossians 1:22g --*Present you before him holy,**blameless** and beyond reproach*...*Blameless* AMOMOS is an adjective that means not having any stain,**<u>flaw</u>**, shame or disgrace.

###### a. A in AMOMOS means without, and MOMOS means **<u>spot</u>** or blemish.

###### b. In this context Paul used this term to describe how God wants to see us in our **<u>lives</u>** here below. Ephesians 5:27, Philippians 2:15

##### 8. Colossians 1:22h --*Present you before him holy, blameless and **beyond reproach***...*Beyond reproach* ANEGKLETOS describes **<u>legal</u>** blamelessness.

###### a. ANEGKLETOS is derived from A meaning **not** and EGKALEO meaning **arraigned**, or **accused before a court of [law</u>**.

###### b. A person who is *beyond reproach* is **<u>free</u>** from indictment or accusations.1 Timothy 3:10, Titus 1:6-7

#### c. Colossians 1:23 -- What did the Colossian believers need in order to **<u>benefit</u>** from the adequacy of Christ in relation to their sanctification? Well, let's look at the information found in this verse?

##### 1. Colossians 1:23a --*If indeed*(1^st^ class condition)*you continue in the **<u>faith</u>**...* Here Paul used a first class condition in Greek as a caution or warning. This statement could read *if... you continue in the faith* and let's assume you will.

###### a. In other words, he assumed his statement to be **<u>true</u>** for the sake of argument. By this grammar he wanted to get his readers' attention.

###### b. The Colossian believers' practical daily sanctification was at **<u>risk</u>**. It was not guaranteed. By using an "if" statement Paul was trying to get them to stop and think.

###### c. Although, by this first class condition the apostle Paul conveyed that he **<u>hoped</u>** they would indeed *continue on in the faith*, it was not absolutely guaranteed that they would. Ultimately their maturity depended on whether or not they would continue *in the faith*.1 Peter 1:15-16

##### 2. Colossians 1:23b --*If indeed you continue in **the [faith</u> ***TE PISTEI... The phrase *the faith* refers to the whole body of Christian truth (God's Word) which was taught to the saints through the apostles and prophets. Galatians 1:23,1 Timothy 4:1, Jude 3

###### a. The apostle Paul **<u>knew</u>** the importance of sticking with sound doctrine. He knew that ***if*** we maintain the integrity of sound doctrine it affects our spiritual progress positively.2 Timothy 4:7

###### b. He equally knew how it could affect us negatively ***if*** we did not **<u>stick</u>** with sound doctrine.1 Timothy 1:19-20

###### c. It is important to understand that *the faith* mentioned here does not refer to our practical **<u>walk</u>** of *faith*. Romans 1:17

##### 3. Colossians 1:23c -- Let us now examine Paul's caution about our spiritual growth.*If indeed you continue in the faith **<u>firmly</u>** established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel*...

###### a. The phrase *firmly established* describes the fact that we have been solidly placed on a **<u>firm</u>** foundation and therefore have every reason to succeed in our sanctification.

####### i.*Firmly established* THEMELIOO is a perfect tense participle that stresses a stability that was established at some point in time in the **<u>past</u>** and continues on into the present.

####### ii. This participle is also in the passive voice communicating that someone else,**<u>God</u>** in this case, provides this stability.

####### iii. Therefore,*if indeed we continue in the faith* based on the **<u>fact</u>** that we have been *firmly established* on a solid foundation, we will be presented before the Lord as *holy, blameless and beyond reproach*.

###### b.***If indeed you continue** in the faith ...steadfast.* The word *steadfast* HEDRAIOS comes from the word **<u>chair</u>** HEDRA and conveys the idea of being settled or secure. A believer's maturity depends on resting entirely, without budging, on the truth received.

###### c.***If indeed you continue** in the faith ...not **<u>moved</u>** away.*

####### i.*Moved away* METAKINEO is a present tense participle stressing that the road to maximum sanctification is to never **shift away from** the **<u>hope</u>** found in the Gospel. Hebrews 3:6

####### ii. The **<u>three</u>** statements *firmly established, steadfast* and *not moved away* would have an emotional connotation for the Colossians.

####### iii. The Lycos Valley, where the small town of Colossae was situated, was a very geologically unstable **<u>region</u>** and could have been dubbed earthquake alley. At about the time of the writing of this epistle, that entire region suffered a massive earthquake.

###### d.*Not moved away **from the <u>hope</u> of the gospel**...* means to not shift away or be shaken from a solid stance on the hope derived from the Gospel. Earlier we learned that the *hope of the gospel* is essential to maintaining fruitfulness. Colossians 1:4-6

##### 4. Colossians 1:23d --*The gospel...* Paul spoke of the dynamic life-altering **<u>power</u>** that emanates from the Gospel. Romans 1:16

###### a.*The gospel that **you [heard</u>**...* The Gospel is a dynamic message. Remember that *faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.* The Colossians had not only heard the Gospel, but we know they also believed it. Romans 10:17, Ephesians 1:13

###### b.*The gospel that you heard,**which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven**...* The **<u>Gospel</u>** is a message that is designed by God to be infectious, untamable and explosive. Romans 5:18

###### c.*The gospel that you heard*...*of which I, Paul, have become a **<u>servant</u>***. Paul willingly suffered and sacrificed for the Gospel because he felt that investing in the Gospel was worth every ounce of his energy.

##### 5. Quick summary: Paul wanted the Colossians to be holy, blameless and beyond reproach before the Lord in their daily lives, yet he **<u>knew</u>** that it was contingent on ongoing steadfast endurance in the truths they had received.

###### a.***If*** they did not continue steadfastly in the **<u>truth</u>** they had received*,* they would not progress in their sanctification. They would not live holy, blameless and beyond reproach before God in their daily lives.

###### b. In the next chapter, Paul presented **<u>four</u>** threats that oppose sanctification (phase two salvation). Any of these threats could easily substitute for Christ and lead believers away from *the faith*.

###### c. Misunderstanding biblical **<u>truth</u>** will translate into inhibited spiritual growth.2 Timothy 3:15, Hebrews 5:12-6:1,1 Peter 2:2

## B.**Colossians 1:24-29 -- The adequacy of Christ in the church, His bride**

### 1. Colossians 1:24 --**<u>Paul</u>** gladly suffered for Christ as he ministered to the church.

#### a. Colossians 1:24a --*Now, I **<u>rejoice</u>** in my suffering*... Paul counted his suffering to be a blessing.2 Timothy 2:10,2 Corinthians 1:5

##### 1.*Rejoice* CHAIRO is a **<u>present</u>** tense verb highlighting Paul's ongoing and continual rejoicing as he suffered for Christ's body, the church. Acts 9:4, Romans 8:17-18

##### 2. Paul rejoiced because of the eternal **<u>value</u>** of suffering together with Christ.2 Corinthians 12:9-10,1 Timothy 1:12-13,1 Peter 1:6

#### b. Colossians 1:24b --...*in my flesh*... Paul experienced physical pain and suffering for Christ and His church. Even while he **<u>wrote</u>** this letter, the apostle was under guards twenty-four hours a day, suffering in chains as a prisoner.2 Corinthians 7:4-5, Ephesians 4:1, Colossians 4:10,2 Timothy 1:8

#### c. Colossians 1:24c --*I do my share on behalf of His **<u>body</u>***. Paul had a purpose in his suffering. In many ways and on multiple occasions Paul endured hazards including weariness, persecutions, and sickness as his contribution to the growth of the church, the body of Christ.2 Corinthians 11:23-28

#### d. Colossians 1:24d --...*in filling up what **<u>lacks</u>** in Christ's afflictions*. Paul considered his sufferings for the church his way of vicariously suffering for Christ.

##### 1. Paul's purpose in suffering was to ***<u>fill</u>** up* that which was still lacking in Christ's sufferings. The phrase *fill up* ANTANAPLEROO communicates the idea of standing in line and waiting patiently to do your part when your turn comes.

##### 2. Since the enemy cannot get at Christ, he targets Christ's **<u>people</u>**.1 Timothy 3:12, Philippians 3:10

##### 3. The union between Christ and His body, the church, is so strong and intimate that Christ takes persecution against the **<u>saints</u>** as a personal injury. Acts 9:4

##### 4. When you **<u>share</u>** in the *afflictions of Christ* through persecution it actually turns out to be intimate fellowship with Christ and great spiritual benefit for the body of Christ.*Death works in us but life in you*.2 Corinthians 4:10-12

### 2. Colossians 1:25 -- Paul took His **<u>service</u>** to Christ's church seriously.

#### a. Colossians 1:25a --*Of this church I was **<u>made</u>** a minister...* God commissioned Paul as a minister DIAKONOS to serve the entire body of Christ. The qualifications of a good steward are faithfulness (Col 1:7), trustworthiness (1 Cor.4:2), and a heart to serve.2 Corinthians 3:5, Philippians 1:21

#### b. Colossians 1:25b --*I was made a minister*...*according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me*. Stewardship OIKONOMIA is a word that describes a superintendent who manages a **<u>household</u>**.

##### 1. In those days the steward was typically a trusted and skilled **<u>slave</u>** who would look after his master's affairs and resources. Luke 12:42

##### 2. In Paul's case he was caring for the most important entity on earth, the **<u>church</u>** of Jesus Christ. Since Paul's day, nations have risen and fallen, organizations have come and gone, and yet after nearly 20 centuries the church marches on. Matthew 16:18

#### c. Colossians 1:25c --*I was made a minister ...for your **<u>benefit</u>**.* Paul felt directly responsible for the Colossian church. We observe that Paul worked, prayed, taught and lived for the sole benefit of God's family. He was not serving for personal gain or glory.1 Thessalonians 2:1-12

#### d. Colossians 1:25d -- The apostle Paul worked very **<u>hard</u>** in his service for the church to *fully carry out the preaching of the word of God*. Colossians 2:1

##### 1. He did not hold **<u>back</u>** anything that was profitable for them in His teaching. Acts 20:20,2 Thessalonians 2:4

##### 2. He taught them the **<u>whole</u>** counsel of God just as we should in our ministry to the church. Acts 20:26-27,2 Corinthians 2:17

### 3. Colossians 1:26-27 -- Paul's goal was to reveal and clarify God's **<u>will</u>** for the church.

#### a. Colossians 1:26a --***That is, the mystery** which has been **<u>hidden</u>** from the past ages and generations*... Paul's task was to dispel any mysteries surrounding the Christian faith by clearly teaching the truth.

##### 1. Interestingly enough, terms like *mystery* MUSTERION and *hidden* APOKRUPTO were later misused by Gnostics to refer to their **<u>secret</u>** ceremonies in their cult worship. They claimed that only the initiated knew and understood mysteries.

##### 2. Under inspiration, Paul included these terms in his **<u>letter</u>** to dispel mysteries and openly correct flawed understanding concerning how to live the abundant life.

##### 3. Without doubt, by means of the book of Colossians, the Holy Spirit preempted the Gnostic heresy as well as many related errors present today. It would be very wise for every individual believer to give special attention to the **<u>truth</u>** found in Colossians.

##### 4. The truth has already been revealed and the mystery dispelled. You do not need some **<u>secret</u>** supernatural revelation or some special new prophecy. You only need to know what has already been revealed in the Word.2 Corinthians 11:2-4

#### b. Colossians 1:26b --*The mystery **which has been****kept hidden from past ages and generations**...* means that the Old Testament prophets and **<u>saints</u>** did not understand the things revealed to us by the apostles and prophets in the New Testament concerning the church. Matthew 13:16-17,34-35; 1 Peter 1:10-12

##### 1. A New Testament mystery refers to openly revealed **<u>truth</u>** that was not previously understood in the Old Testament.

###### a. Romans 16:25 --*Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according **to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept [secret</u> for long ages past**.*

###### b. Romans 16:26 --***but now is manifested**, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to **<u>all</u>** the nations, leading to obedience of faith*.

##### 2. In the New Testament Jesus Christ is **<u>shown</u>** to be both the revelation and essence of *the mystery*. Ephesians 3:1-10

###### a. Ephesians 1:9-10 says,"*He made known to us the mystery of His will... that is, the **summing up of all things in [Christ</u>**, things in the heavens and things on the earth.*" This speaks of Christ's role in our reconciliation.

###### b. Colossians 1:26 says,"*To whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles,**which is [Christ</u> in you**, the hope of glory*." This speaks of Christ's role in our sanctification.

###### c. Colossians 2:2 says,"*That their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the **<u>wealth</u>** that comes from the full assurance of understanding,**resulting in a true knowledge of God\'s mystery, that is, Christ Himself***." This speaks of Christ's adequacy.

##### 3. Our understanding of *mystery* in the New Testament revolves around the person and work of Jesus Christ.

##### 4. Jesus Christ is the summation of everything God wanted to accomplish. Christ was the **<u>answer</u>** to every dilemma man ever had. All the big eternal questions are resolved in Him.

###### a. How would God reconcile Jews, Gentiles and even creation to Himself and then to each other? The mystery was resolved in **<u>Christ</u>**.

###### b. How would God make His reconciled ones holy in their conduct and living? *Christ in us* resolves the mystery of our being **<u>holy</u>** in conduct.

###### c. Colossians 1:26c --*The mystery*...*has now been manifested to His saints*. Paul openly disclosed the whole **<u>truth</u>** to God's people.

##### 1. What a contrast to false teachers who love to boast about being the only ones to understand mysteries and gloat over having an inside **<u>track</u>** with God.

##### 2. Rather than encrypt the message, true Christianity always seeks to make the **<u>whole</u>** church understand the mysteries.

#### d. Colossians 1:27a -- It was to us the **<u>saints</u>***God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery **among the gentiles**.* What was so valuable about the mystery that God would take such great measures to reveal it to us who are Gentiles?

##### 1. Notice that when God revealed the mystery through the preaching of Paul, He willingly decided to include the **<u>Gentiles</u>**.

##### 2. Note carefully that God did not merely reveal this mystery; He made known *the **<u>riches</u> of the glory** of this mystery*.

##### 3. There are great *riches*(PLOUTOS spiritual **<u>wealth</u>**, blessing and abundance) involved in understanding this mystery. Ephesians 3:8-10, Romans 11:33

##### 4. So, what is the mystery? What makes it so valuable?

#### e. Colossians 1:27c -- The mystery is ***<u>Christ</u>** in you the hope of glory*.

##### 1.*Christ in you* means you have His adequacy available to you twenty-four hours a day. This is what makes the abundant **<u>life</u>** possible.

##### 2. This is the unique aspect of Christianity that was never revealed in the Old Testament. This is what gives you a future **<u>hope</u>** of glory. John 7:38-39, Romans 8:23-24,2 Corinthians 1:22, Ephesians 1:14

##### 3. The Old Testament did reveal a coming King who would set up a physical kingdom on earth. The Old Testament revealed that this king would be Immanuel,**<u>God</u>** with us.

##### 4. But the fact that God Himself, in the person of Jesus Christ, would come to **indwell [each</u> individual believer including the Gentiles** is not found anywhere in the Old Testament. This fact was truly an unrevealed mystery.

### 4. Colossians 1:28-29 -- Paul described ongoing and extensive **<u>labor</u>** in His ministry of revealing God's mystery to the church.

#### a. Colossians 1:28a --*We proclaim Him*... Paul and the other apostles proclaimed a **<u>person</u>**, Jesus Christ, as God's provision for abundant living.1 Timothy 3:16

##### 1. Paul did not preach some program, system of religion, catechism, process, experience or philosophy as the **<u>answer</u>** for living a victorious Christian life.

##### 2. In the same way, we ought to proclaim dependence on Jesus Christ, the person of God's mystery, as the **<u>sole</u>** fountain out of which we live the abundant life. John 7:37-39

#### b. Colossians 1:28b -- By ...***admonishing****<u>every</u>** man,* Paul sought to reveal the mystery to every believer. We can think of admonishment as teaching with a corrective twist.

##### 1.*Admonish* NOUTHETEO is a present tense participle derived from NOUS meaning mind and TITHEMI meaning to place or put. Paul emphatically and repeatedly impressed the truth on their **<u>minds</u>**.

##### 2. This is like a **<u>parent</u>** who brandishes something into a child's thinking by repeated warning. Admonish is a stronger concept than mere teaching.1 Thessalonians 2:11

##### 3. By implication, we as Bible teachers should persevere in the task of putting the truth of God's Word into the **<u>hearts</u>** of our audience. We do this practically by repeated warning, caution, reproof and exhortation.

#### c. Colossians 1:28c --***Teaching** every **<u>man</u>** with all wisdom*. Paul not only corrected the church through **admonishment**, he **taught** everyone by instruction.2 Timothy 4:2,24

##### 1. Teaching is a ministry of explanation and clarification as opposed to the corrective **<u>nature</u>** of admonishment.

##### 2. Teaching is the process of systematically **<u>laying</u>** out truth.

##### 3. Although admonishment is always important, Paul went a step **<u>further</u>**. He also ***taught*** the whole church with great wisdom and careful instruction.2 Timothy 4:2

##### 4. Through instruction he explained the **<u>life</u>**-changing objectives of the mystery *Christ in you*.

##### 5. This is reiterated in the added phrase *teaching ...**with [all</u> wisdom***. The teaching Paul described here is not just the transfer of knowledge. Wisdom actually applies the acquired knowledge. Philippians 1:9-10

##### 6. We discern a very practical **<u>goal</u>** in Paul's teaching. His learners were not merely filling up notebooks with Bible truth; their lives were actually being changed by truth. John 17:17, Romans 12:2,1 Thessalonians 1:5-6,1 Timothy 1:5,2 Timothy 3:16-17

#### d. Colossians 1:28d -- Paul proclaimed the mystery ***Christ in you*** with a specific objective in mind. He taught and explained the mystery in order to *present **<u>every</u>** man complete in Christ*.

##### 1. The phrase ***every man*** PANTA ANTHROPON is found **<u>three</u>** times in this verse and is a phrase that includes both genders, male and female.

##### 2. This phrase highlights the need we all have of understanding in a practical sense what ***<u>Christ</u>** in you* really means.

##### 3. Christ lives in **<u>every</u>** believer but not all believers understand the life-changing significance of this fact. This verse shows how Paul put his life on the line to communicate to every believer this foundational truth.

#### e. Colossians 1:28e --...*so that we may **present** every man **<u>complete</u> in Christ***. Paul preached the mystery of Christ with the anticipation of presenting everyone complete and mature in Christ in his or her daily life. Galatians 2:20, Colossians 1:22-23

##### 1. The idea of *present* here is a flashback to verse 22 where he spoke of presenting us before **<u>God</u>** holy, blameless and beyond reproach in our daily lives as believers.

##### 2. Paul did not simply want to evangelize people. He worked tirelessly to see those who believe achieve the ultimate goal. He strove to present them to God **<u>mature</u>**.

##### 3. So what does it mean to present someone *complete in Christ*?

###### a.*Complete* is the Greek word TELEIOS and means **<u>mature</u>** or fully-grown. It describes something that has all its essential parts. What Paul was pursuing in his service was that every believer would **<u>grow</u>** and become fully mature.

###### b. Paul wanted all believers in the church to **<u>enjoy</u>** the full richness of the abundant life and not to stumble through life or simply exist. John 10:10b

###### c. He did not want even **<u>one</u>** son or daughter of God to fail to achieve spiritual completeness. Galatians 4:19; Ephesians 3:14-19,4:13; Philippians 3:10-14

###### d. Paul knew that completeness relied on how well they understood God's **<u>will</u>** for believers -- the hope-giving mystery of the abundant life -- the mystery of *Christ in you*.

#### f. Colossians 1:29a --*For this purpose I **<u>labor</u>**.* Paul was so absolutely convinced of the importance of the mystery he willingly gave his all for its expansion.

##### 1. The Greek word *labor* KOPIAO means to work until one is completely worn out and depleted of all **<u>energy</u>**. This word was used to describe exhausting labor. Paul did not give minimal effort; he strove to the point of exhaustion.

##### 2. Paul used the term ***<u>labor</u>*** in the present tense to communicate his present ongoing intensive exertions for them.

##### 3. In order to communicate *Christ in you, the hope of glory* to the church, Paul gave it his all, even to the **<u>point</u>** of extreme physical exhaustion.

#### g. Colossians 1:29b --*For this purpose I labor,**<u>striving</u>**...* The word *striving* AGONIZOMAI was used to describe extreme effort especially through discomfort. We get our English word agonize from this Greek word*.*

##### 1. In ancient writings the word AGONIZOMAI described the **<u>extreme</u>** exertions of those who contended in public sports, fights and wrestling matches.1 Corinthians 9:25

##### 2. AGONIZOMAI conveyed the idea of straining to the extreme to **<u>win</u>**. We might understand the meaning of the word when we compare it with the thrust of an athlete who, in order to win, strains on even while every muscle screams,"Quit."

#### h. Colossians 1:29c --*Striving according to his power which mightily works **within me***... Notice the **<u>sphere</u>** in which God worked; it was *within* Paul. This speaks of God being at work for the good of others in and through a presented servant.

##### 1. God's **<u>work</u>** through Paul was not primarily based on Paul's abilities. It was based on God's enablement.2 Corinthians 3:4-5

###### a. It was not **<u>through</u>** his superior education in Judaism that God worked, even though, to be sure, his education was extensive and impressive. Acts 22:3, Philippians 3:6-8

###### b. God did not **<u>work</u>** through the apostle Paul based on his heritage, even though he was a *Hebrew of the Hebrews*. Romans 11:1,2 Corinthians 11:22, Philippians 3:5

###### c. It was not because of his expert methodologies, his impressive **<u>mission</u>** strategies or even his great work ethic that God was able to work through Paul. Romans 15:15-18,1 Corinthians 15:9-11

##### 2. God was able to work through Paul simply because Paul was a presented **<u>vessel</u>** God could freely use. God empowers presented people for effective service. Romans 15:13,2 Corinthians 4:7

###### a. This is something totally **<u>foreign</u>** to the experience of the unsaved.

###### b. This is also something that **<u>carnal</u>** believers do not appreciate and seldom experience practically because they live relying on human wisdom rather than on the power of God. Jeremiah 17:5-8,1 Corinthians 2:4-5

#### i. Colossians 1:29d -- Finally, a literal translation of this verse reads,*"for which also I **<u>labor</u>**, striving according to his working **ENERGEIA** that is working **ENERGEO** in me in powerfully **DYNAMEI***."

##### 1.*Striving according to His working*...*Working* ENERGEIA is a noun that means effective,**<u>active</u>** or pertaining to action.

##### 2.*That is working ENERGEO in me*... The verb *working* ENERGEO is a present tense, middle voice participle in Greek. It means that **<u>God</u>** was the One energetically at work, being effective and producing results in and through the apostle.

##### 3.*Working in me, in **<u>power</u>** DYNAMIS*... The noun *power* DYNAMIS communicates force, might or energy.

##### 4. The same nouns ENERGEIA and DUNAMIS, and the verb ENERGEO were used to describe the **<u>power</u>** God exerted in the resurrection of Christ from the dead.

##### 5. Ephesians 1:19-20 --*These are in accordance with the **working*****ENERGEIA***of the strength of His might***DUNAMIS***, which He **brought about*****ENERGEO***in Christ, when He **<u>raised</u>** Him from the dead*...

##### 6. We can conclude that Paul strove **<u>hard</u>** in his mission efforts but only by actively receiving a constant infusion of God's power. He was not trusting in himself. He was trusting in the power of Christ. Remember *Christ in you* is the mystery of God revealed.

# V.**Colossians 2:1-7 -- God's Protection From Heresies: Understanding the Mystery of Christ**

## A.**Colossians 2:1-3 -- Paul waged a war**

### 1. Colossians 2:1 -- Paul was engaged in a grueling and arduous **<u>struggle</u>** for the churches of the Lycos valley.

#### a. Colossians 2:1a --*For I want you to know*... The opening word ***<u>for</u>*** ties this section back to the previous passage. This is not a new topic but a continuation of the apostle's deep concern for the churches beginning back in Colossians 1:24.

#### b. Colossians 2:1b --*How great a struggle* conveys the idea of an enormous contest, conflict or battle. Paul was aggressively **<u>fighting</u>** for the lasting existence of the church in that region of the world.

##### 1. Paul was deeply distressing over them. The word *striving* AGONIZOMAI in Colossians 1:29 has the same **<u>root</u>** as the word *struggle* AGON in Colossians 2:1. We get our English word agony from this term.

##### 2. Paul used *struggle* as a **<u>present</u>** tense verb, communicating his ongoing pastoral care and concern for the Colossians. Day in and day out, Paul passionately struggled for their success.

#### c. Colossians 2:1c --*How great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face*. Here we observe the **<u>depth</u>** of the conflict of soul Paul experienced for the Colossian church.

##### 1. Paul wanted the **<u>entire</u>** church body to know he was waging all-out war through intercessory prayer for them.

##### 2. Remarkably, even though Paul did not personally **<u>know</u>** most of these churches, he nonetheless prayed intensely for their spiritual progress. What a call to action for us today to pray even for churches we do not personally know.

### 2. Colossians 2:2 --*That their **<u>hearts</u>** may be encouraged*... The word *that* HINA conveys purpose. Paul had a two-fold purpose in his intercessory struggle for the believers: 1) that their hearts might be encouraged, and 2) that they might attain to **<u>all</u>** the wealth which was already theirs in Christ.

#### a. Colossians 2:2a --*That their hearts may be encouraged, having been **<u>knit</u>** together in love*... The apostle Paul knew that when the body of Christ is *knit together in love* it will result in encouraged believers.

##### 1. The word *encourage* PARAKALEO means to come beside and urge forward. Encouragement comes from knowing you are not in the battle **<u>alone</u>**; someone is at your side. Ephesians 4:15-16

##### 2. Although we are many members in the body of Christ, Christ has only **<u>one</u>** body. Christ wants all the members of His body to work together for mutual growth and then as one unit to be the pillar of light and truth in the world.1 Corinthians 12:11-14, Ephesians 2:21-22, Philippians 1:27,1 Timothy 3:15

##### 3. Great encouragement comes in true Christian **<u>unity</u>**. Christians get involved in all sorts of dead-end activities supposing they'll find inspiration for life. We must understand that we will never find true encouragement outside of Christ and His body. Philippians 2:2

##### 4. Unity has the power to **<u>calm</u>** and console our hearts. Paul understood the importance of unity so keenly that without hesitation he fell to his knees in spiritual combat, begging God for true unity in the body of Christ.

#### b. Colossians 2:2b --***And attaining** to all the wealth...* Paul struggled in prayer for the believers to know and understand all the **<u>wealth</u>** that was theirs in Christ.

##### 1. In Christ we have been **<u>blessed</u>** with unfathomable spiritual wealth. Ephesians 1:3,3:8-9; 2 Peter 3:18

##### 2. A person, whether rich or poor, who comes to **<u>know</u>** God's mystery, Jesus Christ, as revealed in the Scriptures is a wealthy person indeed. Philippians 3:7-14

#### c. Colossians 2:2c --...*that comes from the full assurance*... In contrast to the discouragement of uncertainty, God wants us to be encouraged, being **<u>fully</u>** assured of the truth of His Word and of His abundant grace so that we can come to truly bask in all the wealth that is ours in Christ.

##### 1. The phrase ***<u>full</u>** assurance* reminds us that we can be certain of the truth of God's Word.

##### 2. We live in a world where people jokingly say that nothing is sure except **<u>death</u>** and taxes. Popular culture likewise teaches there is no absolute truth. John 18:38

##### 3. On the contrary, the cry of Jesus, the apostle Paul, and virtually all of Scripture is that you can **<u>know</u>** truth and that truth brings freedom. John 8:32

#### d. We live in a day when many teachers assert that it is good to live with a healthy **<u>doubt</u>** concerning salvation. To these preachers it is a good thing to have a degree of uncertainty and insecurity about your salvation.

##### 1. Some teachers say that you cannot ever truly know if you are actually saved until you die. They contend that if you continue faithful to Christ all your life then, and only then, can you be **<u>sure</u>** you were truly saved.

##### 2. Sadly, those who believe this become **<u>guilty</u>** of teaching a gospel of salvation by works.

##### 3. When you believe that good works play a part in your salvation, you will be subjected to great uncertainty and insecurity and will not **<u>enjoy</u>** the assurance Paul wanted the Colossians to possess.

##### 4. Paul stated that his goal was for believers to attain *to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding*. The purpose of the New Testament is not to **<u>cast</u>** doubts on our salvation but rather to provide solid assurance of our salvation. John 20:30-31,2 Timothy 1:1,1 John 5:10-13

#### e. Colossians 2:2c --*...that comes from the full assurance of understanding...* Paul used the phrase *assurance of understanding* to convey the idea of **<u>reason</u>** based on logical deduction.

##### 1. Having a scriptural understanding of **<u>Christ</u>** and His salvation is absolutely essential for assurance. Without assurance of our position in Christ and the grace in which we stand, we cannot enjoy all the wealth that is ours in Christ.2 Peter 1:3-4

##### 2. The **<u>false</u>** teaching infiltrating the church of Colossae mirrored much of what we see in churches today. We are told that Christ is not sufficient for our needs. We are led to believe we need a new philosophy, more rules and regulations, new experiences, or more self-control to dominate our desires.

##### 3. All these errors **<u>remove</u>** believers from Christ's adequacy and diminish His value as the resolver of life's problems.

#### f. Colossians 2:2d --...*resulting in a **<u>true</u>** knowledge of God\'s mystery, that is, Christ Himself*.

##### 1. The unfathomable **<u>riches</u>**, wealth and grace God has for us are found solely in the person of Jesus Christ.2 Peter 1:3-4

##### 2. Paul struggled (Col.2:1) and labored (Col.1:29) in prayer for the Colossian believers and the neighboring churches to **<u>truly</u>** understand God's mystery, which is Christ Himself.

### 3. Colossians 2:3a -- Paul wanted Christ, God's mystery, to be **<u>clearly</u>** understood by the Colossians because all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are found only in ***Christ***. We need to know that the "secret" to spiritual living is found hidden in Christ.

#### a. Colossians 2:8-9 -- In this chapter we will see that the **<u>secret</u>** to godly living is not found in some human philosophy.

##### 1. A **<u>new</u>** philosophy or someone claiming to have higher knowledge could have easily bedazzled some first century believers.

##### 2. Even today some believers teach that life's answers are found in a mix of Freudian thought and **<u>biblical</u>** truth.

##### 3. Since many say,"All truth is God's truth," some believers teach that secular philosophy must be acceptable, but just because **<u>truth</u>** belongs to God does not mean that the philosophy of this world is correct. James 3:13-18

##### 4. We can know with certainty that the treasure trove of wisdom and knowledge is found **<u>only</u>** in God's mystery, Jesus Christ. Colossians 2:3

#### b. Colossians 2:16-17 -- The secret to godly living is not found in ritualistic or religious **<u>legalism</u>**.

##### 1. Those who teach that you must keep the law to be a faithful Christian and pleasing to God end up replacing a life of *grace through **<u>faith</u>*** with human efforts.

##### 2. These individuals have not found Jesus Christ to be God's unique provision for godly living. They replace fellowship with Christ for a **<u>list</u>** of rules and regulations.

##### 3. On the outside, legalistic Christians may seem to be doing everything right, but they are missing out on the joy of **<u>true</u>** fellowship with Jesus Christ. These believers tend to be mechanical in their Christianity while lacking the vibrancy of fellowship with Christ.2 Timothy 3:5

##### 4. The Pharisees lived barren lives. On the outside you could not find fault with their way of living, but they were **<u>cold</u>**-hearted, selfish and covetous on the inside and devoid of a real relationship with God. Matthew 23:25, Luke 11:39, John 8:19

##### 5. Legalists tend to be judgmental,**<u>harsh</u>** and unyielding, smugly feeling that they are the only ones truly right with God.

#### c. Colossians 2:18-19 -- The secret to godly living is not found in having **<u>mystical</u>** experiences.

##### 1. Those who teach this error replace a biblical relationship with **<u>Christ</u>** for supernatural experiences.

##### 2. If they have to make a choice, they are be apt place higher value on their experiences than on the **<u>Word</u>** of God.

##### 3. If they have to decide between something they saw or experienced and what the **<u>Bible</u>** actually says, they usually go with the former over the written Word of God.

#### d. Colossians 2:20-23 -- And finally the secret to godly living is not **<u>found</u>** in personal asceticism.

##### 1. The ascetic Christian believes that by self-imposed harshness or personal humiliation he will gain greater spirituality and freedom from indulging in fleshly **<u>sins</u>**.

##### 2. Things like eastern yoga, transcendental meditation and special **<u>diets</u>** do not hold the answer to true peace and prosperous living. The fact is that the reverse actually happens.

##### 3. As long as a believer continues to faithfully apply the pressures of asceticism, he or she can produce external conformity, but the moment one relaxes, the **<u>flesh</u>** comes back with a vengeance. Colossians 2:23

### 4. Colossians 2:3b -- Christ is the person ...***in whom are [hidden</u> all the treasures** of wisdom and knowledge.*

#### a. There are incredible **<u>riches</u>** in understanding the plans and purposes of God. There is incomprehensible wealth in a complete knowledge of God's infinite thoughts and insights stockpiled in knowing Christ Jesus our Lord.

#### b. There is not one ounce of **<u>wisdom</u>** or knowledge that you need for living this life that is not already accessible to you in intimately knowing Jesus Christ.2 Peter 1:3

### 5. Colossians 2:3c -- Christ ...*in whom are hidden all the treasures **of wisdom and knowledge***. Everything you need for abundant **<u>godly</u>** living is found in intimately knowing Jesus Christ.

#### a.*Knowledge* is God-given enlightenment to be able to understand His Word and **<u>will</u>**.

#### b.*Wisdom* is the God-given ability to go on and practically use the knowledge of God's Word and will in your **<u>daily</u>** living.

#### c. The believer who only superficially or academically knows the **<u>Lord</u>** does not truly possess or experience this understanding. Christ is a person to intimately know not a school subject to learn. To know the Lord translates into a dependent walk of faith. Psalm 9:10, Daniel 11:32, John 17:3, Hebrews 12:1-2

## B.**Colossians 2:4-5 -- Paul warned of danger**

### 1. Colossians 2:4 --*I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument*. Paul warned the Colossians not to be **<u>tricked</u>**. Galatians 1:6-9,3:1

#### a. Colossians 2:4a -- Paul was worried the Colossians might be in **<u>danger</u>** of delusion....*so that no one will delude you*...2 Corinthians 11:3-4,13-15

##### 1. The word *delude* PARALOGIZOMAI is a two-part word in Greek. PARA means **with** or **beside** and LOGIZOMAI means **to reason** or **to use logic**. You might say it means to add or combine something with **<u>reason</u>** or logic.

##### 2. Deceit is exactly that. It is a clever combination of falsehood with **<u>good</u>** reasoning.

##### 3. Even though in the very next verse Paul was complimentary of these Colossian Christians because they were presently standing **<u>firm</u>**, it is clear from this warning that even the "strongest" Christian can be deceived and must therefore remain on guard and take heed to this warning. Colossian 2:5

#### b. Colossians 2:4b --*With persuasive argument...* False teachers often **<u>seek</u>** to win converts through wise-sounding arguments that are untrue.2 Peter 2:1,17-19

##### 1. False teachers seldom come through the front **<u>door</u>** proclaiming their unorthodoxies in clear language. Acts 20:29-31

###### a. Instead false teachers use persuasive **<u>words</u>** to gain an audience with unsuspecting believers. They then stealthily steer them towards their devious goals.2 Corinthians 2:17a; Jude 4,8,10-16,18-19

###### b. Your real protection is putting on Christ as portrayed in the individual pieces of the **<u>armor</u>** of God. Romans 13:12-14, Ephesians 6:10-18

##### 2. The Colossians already owned the full treasure of God's wisdom and knowledge in the person of Jesus Christ; they did not need to look beyond Him for acquiring **<u>truth</u>**. Colossians 2:3,3:15-16

##### 3. What kind of logic might charm you? What smooth sounding rhetoric might trick you? Acceptance of what **<u>seems</u>** to be right, without checking it against the Word of God, has led to the downfall of many. Acts 17:11

### 2. Colossians 2:5 --*For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit...* Paul used military lingo to compliment the Colossian believers on their readiness to **<u>fight</u>**.

#### a. Colossians 2:5a --Even though Paul was not physically present in Colossae, in his **<u>spirit</u>** he was *rejoicing to see \[their\] good discipline*.

##### 1. In using the term *good discipline* TAXIS, Paul employed a military concept used to describe a well-ordered, descending-in-**<u>rank</u>**, combat-ready squadron of soldiers.

##### 2. Even though there were **<u>false</u>** teachers afoot, the apostle felt confident that the Colossians were battle-ready.

##### 3. Are we set for defense when it comes to false teaching? Have we adopted the modern don't-rock-the-boat mindset of **<u>tolerance</u>** when it comes to doctrinal differences? May this not be the case.

#### b. Colossians 2:5b -- Paul also rejoiced to see their **<u>stability</u>**.*Rejoicing to see ...the stability of your faith in Christ*.

##### 1. The word for *stability* STEREOMA means firm,**<u>solid</u>** or stable. Originally the term described the military stance developed by the Greeks where shields were overlapped and spears extended as troops moved forward in unison.

##### 2. By using this term, Paul metaphorically described the unity of the Colossian church. He considered them a **<u>firm</u>**, unyielding and close-knit unit.

##### 3. Their stability was based on their ***<u>faith</u>** in Christ* not on their personal strengths. Paul perceived that they were firmly leaning on Christ and he knew this would ensure their ultimate victory.

#### c. In summary, Paul rejoiced because he was sure the Colossian believers were on guard **<u>against</u>** false teaching.

##### 1. They stood as a well-prepared and disciplined group of **<u>soldiers</u>**.

##### 2. They stood with an arm-in-arm posture in their active **<u>faith</u>** in Christ.

##### 3. Quite obviously Paul had done a **<u>great</u>** job of discipleship with Epaphras. As a disciple-maker, Epaphras had gone forth and duplicated Paul's efforts in the lives of the Colossians.

## C.**Colossians 2:6-7 -- Paul pointed toward Christ**

### 1. Colossians 2:6 --*Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him*. This is the first **<u>directive</u>** given to believers in the book of Colossians.

#### a. Colossians 2:6a --*As you received Christ Jesus **<u>the</u>** Lord...* is a good translation of the Greek text.

##### 1. This verse should **<u>not</u>** read as the NIV, NET, and NLT Bible translators rendered it: *as you received Christ Jesus **as** Lord*.

##### 2. This would be the **<u>only</u>** place in the NT where the word "*the*"(*ton*) is translated using the English word "as."

##### 3. We did not receive Christ Jesus **as** Lord, but we did receive *Christ Jesus **<u>the</u>** Lord*.

###### a. Our salvation was not a promise, effort or **<u>deal</u>** we struck with God whereby we made Him Lord of our lives in order to merit salvation.

###### b. We received Christ as our Savior by simple childlike **<u>faith</u>** in the person and work of Christ. Acts 16:31, Ephesians 2:8-9, John 3:16-17

#### b. Colossians 2:6b --*As you **<u>received</u>** Christ... so walk in Him...* Paul wanted the Colossian believers to continue to walk with Christ in the very same way they first received Him.

##### 1. What we see here is that in the same way we received Christ by **<u>faith</u>** at salvation we are now commanded to daily walk in Him.

###### a. According to John 1:12, to receive Jesus Christ is to **<u>believe</u>** in His name. His name represents who He is and what He did. As Christ, He is the God-man who died for our sins and rose again the third day.

###### b. Galatians 3:3 shows that we began our Christian walk by means of the Holy Spirit and therefore we are to continue on in the power of the Holy Spirit and **<u>not</u>** resort to the power of the flesh. By faith we walk according to the Holy Spirit.2 Corinthians 5:7

###### c. Hebrews 10:38 shows that if we as believers pull **<u>back</u>** from a walk of faith we displease our Lord. Hebrews 11:6

###### d. Romans 1:17 teaches that the justified person is to **<u>live</u>** from faith to faith.*For in it the righteousness of God is revealed **from faith to faith**; as it is written,"BUT THE RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY FAITH."*

##### 2. Colossians 2:6c -- What did Paul mean by ... so ***<u>walk</u>** in Him*?

###### a. The action verb *walk* PERIPATEO comes from PERI meaning around and PATEO to walk. Since Paul used the word *walk* as a **<u>present</u>** tense command it communicated the requirement to walk this way right now. Paul instructed the Colossians to daily walk with the Lord by faith.

###### b. We are to go about walking with Jesus in the same way we first trusted in Him. We received Him by faith and that is **<u>how</u>** we are to now walk with Him. Galatians 3:2-3

###### c. Every day you should wake up and walk about trusting Christ to live His life in and through you. In both **<u>public</u>** and private aspects of your life you are commanded to walk by faith. We are to daily, not just on Sunday, walk in this way. Galatians 2:20

###### d. We are to keep in step with the Holy Spirit,**<u>yoked</u>** together with Him. Romans 8:13, Galatians 5:16

##### 3. Colossians 2:6d --...***<u>in</u>** Him*. At salvation all believers are placed into Christ. Galatians 3:27

###### a. When you became a believer, you were born again as a **<u>new</u>** creation into the body of Christ. You are no longer in Adam. You now have a new identity in Christ.2 Corinthians 5:17

###### b. Ephesians 1:3 -- In Christ you have been **<u>blessed</u>***with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places*. Colossian 3:1-3

### 2. Colossians 2:7 -- Using the metaphor of a **<u>tree</u>**, Paul explained what your experience will be as you *walk* and mature in Christ.

#### a. Colossians 2:7a --*Having been firmly rooted*... At salvation we became firmly **<u>rooted</u>** in Christ. Ephesians 3:17

##### 1. Because this participle ***<u>rooted</u>*** RHIZOO is in the perfect tense, it implies an ongoing present reality that was established at a past event.

##### 2. The believer was rooted in Christ at the point of **<u>faith</u>** alone in Christ alone for salvation. Afterward in daily living the believer continues on deeply rooted in Christ as His source.

##### 3. Being rooted speaks of stability. There is no greater stability than being **<u>firmly</u>** rooted in Jesus Christ, God Himself, who fully paid our sin-debt and rose again on our behalf. Romans 8:31-39

##### 4. Being rooted speaks of nourishment. Truly our ability to stand in **<u>life</u>** comes from Christ alone. He is the life-giving vine and we are the branches. Without Him we can indeed do nothing. Psalm 92:13; Jeremiah 17:7-8; John 15:1,2

#### b. Colossians 2:7b --*And now being built up in Him*... You begin your Christian life by being rooted in **<u>Christ</u>**. God's maturation process is that you continue to grow up into Christ.

##### 1. God would have you expand **<u>upward</u>** through practical, daily, faith-based fellowship with Christ. Ephesians 4:15b

##### 2.*Built up* EPOIKODOMEO means to be built up in **<u>layers</u>**, one on top of the other. This is precisely how a tree grows. Every year a new layer is added on top of the old one. Usually there is about 1 month of new growth resulting in a new ring and then about 11 months of solidification.

##### 3. Although *built up* is in the present tense, it is also in the passive voice. This means that not only is **<u>God</u>** the one who gives the growth, He is continually working to make you grow.1 Corinthians 3:6-10

#### c. Colossians 2:7c --*And established in your faith just as you were instructed*... As you mature, not only should you be built up and grow up into Christ, you should become established in your faith. This reminds us of a large tree standing beside the **<u>water</u>**. Psalm 1:3

##### 1. We become firmly established in our lives by retaining what we were originally **<u>taught</u>**. Galatians 5:7-8, Ephesians 4:11-14,2 Timothy 3:14-15

##### 2. The word *established* BEBAIOO is a present tense passive voice participle that describes a believer who is in the process of becoming firmly **<u>docked</u>** in *the faith*, the body of truth we believe.

##### 3. Epaphras had apparently **<u>taught</u>** the Colossian believers very well, but the present tense verb *established* highlights for us the ongoing need of being daily established in the truth. Ephesians 4:22-24

##### 4. Ephesians 4:12b-13 --...*to the building up of the body of Christ; **<u>until</u>** we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ*.

#### d. Colossians 2:7d --*And overflowing with gratitude*. The metaphor now pictures a **<u>fruit</u>**-bearing tree. We come to experience a bumper-crop of gratitude.

##### 1. The word *overflowing* PERISSEUO means abounding, spilling over, or **<u>filled</u>** to the brim. As we walk by faith we can expect to burst with gratitude.

##### 2. This thanksgiving speaks of internal transformation, a true **<u>mark</u>** of someone who is walking by faith and growing in Christ.

##### 3. Pseudo-spirituality, created by the heresies we are about to see,**<u>changes</u>** our actions but not our attitudes.

##### 4. The four heresies of Colossians 2 are merely external modifications. On the contrary, the metaphor of **<u>growth</u>** as shown in this passage deals with internal change that results in fruit-bearing. This is what God wants and this is only available in Christ, God's revealed mystery.1 Timothy 3:16

# VI.**Colossians 2:8-23 -- Examining the Four Heresies of Colossae**

## A.**Colossians 2:8-10 -- Philosophy, the first heresy**

### 1. Colossians 2:8 -- Paul **<u>warned</u>** of the danger of philosophy. Proverbs 1:1-7

#### a. Colossians 2:8a -- The phrase ...*see to it*... is a **<u>present</u>** tense command followed by the Greek negation ME giving the command an emphasis akin to,"Watch out!" Since the command is in the active voice, it was their personal responsibility to have ongoing vigilance.

#### b. Colossians 2:8b --*See to it that no one takes you **<u>captive</u>***... is language that was used to describe a person taken as a prisoner of war. In those days, being a POW meant you'd eventually be sold and become someone's slave.

##### 1. Most casualties or converts to cults come out of **<u>churches</u>** rather than directly from the unsaved world.

##### 2. In other words, unsuspecting and unguarded Christians easily fall captive to **<u>cults</u>**. You must not forget that you are in a deadly battle. You should not fall asleep in your good profession of Christ or get complacent in your faith. That is dangerous.1 Timothy 1:18-20

#### c. Colossians 2:8c --*See to it that no one takes you captive **<u>through</u>** philosophy*. The heresy of philosophy is the error of falling prey to a deceptive human viewpoint.

##### 1. In Greek the word *philosophy* PHILOSOPHIA is a compound word derived from PHILOS friend and SOPHIA wisdom. It literally means the **<u>love</u>** of wisdom or science. This is the only occurrence of this word in the Bible.

##### 2. Thayer's Lexicon defines philosophy as the "love and **<u>pursuit</u>** of wisdom." Thayer stated that philosophy was used in Greek writings to describe skill in, or zeal for, any art, science or branch of knowledge.

##### 3. Interestingly, Paul's singular use of the word came with a negative overtone describing worthless human speculation and misleading substitutes for **<u>truth</u>**.

##### 4. It would be good here to consider the **<u>major</u>** schools of philosophy embraced in Roman society at the time. These philosophies are still very prevalent in one form or another in our world today.

###### a.**<u>Five</u>** schools of philosophy were important or prominent in the time of Paul's writings. They were Cynicism, Hedonism, Skepticism, Stoicism and Epicureanism.

###### b. By the time of Paul, Greek philosophy had undergone a **<u>change</u>** in focus from what ancient philosophers wanted to understand. Originally they tried to understand the primary principles of existence, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time and space (metaphysics).

###### c. However, in the days of the writing of the New Testament, philosophers were more interested in knowing how to be dignified and live a good life than to understand the basis of life itself. Their focus shifted to understanding issues of **<u>ethics</u>**, virtue and quality of character.

###### d. Two schools of philosophy ought to be considered because their devotees are mentioned in Acts 17:18. These philosophers ridiculed Paul's teachings about the Christ and the resurrection of the **<u>dead</u>**.

####### i. The first school of philosophy was Stoicism.

######## a. Zeno of Citium founded stoicism in Athens circa 300 BC. This teaching claimed that wisdom was gained by abstinence from **<u>passion</u>**.

######## b. Stoics believed that wisdom was attainable through meditation and an indifference to **<u>pain</u>** and pleasure.

######## c. Stoicism postulated that wisdom occurs when **<u>reason</u>** controls passions. Conversely evil occurs when passion controls a person.

######## d. Interestingly, Stoic philosophies **<u>led</u>** to virtuous living by relying on self-discipline and self-restraint.

####### ii. The second school of philosophy was Epicureanism.

######## a. Generally Epicureanism, established in Athens circa BC 300 by Epicurus, had little concern for religion. To them religion and ignorance went **<u>hand</u>** in hand.

######## b. According to their reasoning, gods existed, but **<u>far</u>** off in space, and they were generally disinterested in humanity.

######## c. Epicureans did not believe in **<u>life</u>** after death, making them the Greek version of Jewish Sadducees.

######## d. Epicureanism was typically the philosophy of the nobility who wanted to be deemed **<u>wise</u>** and virtuous in public, yet in their private lives they practiced hedonism, or carnal pleasure, since ultimately happiness was the true goal of their lives.

####### iii. Even though these two philosophies were based on **<u>vastly</u>** different paradigms, their outworking in society was similar. In public life, both Stoics and Epicureans sought to be virtuous.

##### 5. Philosophy does not have the **<u>Word</u>** of God as its authority. Ultimately all philosophies seek to explain or understand life apart from Christ as our source and adequacy.

###### a. Because of this sad fact, without doubt any human philosophy will ultimately lead you **<u>away</u>** from God. Instead of leading you to rely on God, it will lead you to rely on the wisdom of men for life's answers.

###### b. It is important to **<u>note</u>** that ***philosophy***, not **knowledge**, is what is condemned here.

#### d. Colossians 2:8d -- According to Paul, philosophy is ***<u>empty</u>***.

##### 1. When it came to explaining the issues of life, Paul called philosophy *empty**deception*. In Greek the word *empty* KENOS means **<u>without</u>** substance; it describes the hollow or foolish distortion that leads to disillusionment. Philosophy cannot satisfy the nagging questions of life.

##### 2. In the Phillips New Testament this word was translated as *high-sounding **<u>nonsense</u>***. That's a pretty good description.

##### 3. In Deuteronomy 32:45-47 when relating God's words to the Israelites, Moses said,"*For it is not an idle word for you; indeed it is your **<u>life</u>***." God's Word is not without substance. Quite the contrary. God's Word gives life. Psalm 119:105, Proverbs 6:23,2 Peter 1:19

#### e. Colossians 2:8e -- Philosophy is not only *empty,* it is **<u>deceptive</u>**.

##### 1. Philosophy is described as *deception* APETE. Deception is that which gives a **<u>false</u>** impression or is unreliable or corrupt.

##### 2. The word *deception* APETE means to **<u>trick</u>**. Philosophy's *empty deception* aptly describes mankind's enticing words of intellectualism.

##### 3. Paul, being well-acquainted with the philosophies of his **<u>day</u>**, regarded them with suspicion and rejection. He was quick to call them deceptive and misleading.

##### 4. What place does philosophy hold in your life? Are you getting your understanding for life from philosophy's human viewpoints found in self-help books, media, the Internet, the education system, or from the precious Word of Christ? Colossians 3:15-16

### 2. Colossians 2:8 -- Paul showed why philosophy was **<u>deficient</u>** and to be decisively rejected.

#### a. Colossians 2:8f -- We ought to reject philosophy because of its **<u>source</u>**. Philosophy is ...*according to the traditions of men*.

##### 1. Paul knew that the philosophy of his day and its adherents, e.g., Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, followed the traditions of **<u>men</u>**.

##### 2. The Greek culture's ancestors had **<u>passed</u>** down philosophy from generation to generation in a written format. So when Paul described where philosophy originated, he was quick to show that its source was man, not God. James 3:13-18

##### 3.1 Corinthians 1:19-20 --*For it is written,\"I WILL **<u>DESTROY</u>** THE WISDOM OF THE WISE, AND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE.\" Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world*?

##### 4.1 Corinthians 1:21 -- Fo*r since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to **<u>save</u>** those who believe*.

##### 5.1 Corinthians 2:6 --*Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God\'s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our **<u>glory</u>***.

#### b. Colossians 2:8g -- We should reject philosophy because of its **<u>substance</u>**. Philosophy is ...*according to the elementary principles of this world*.

##### 1. The word *elementary* STOICHEION comes from a word meaning to **<u>line</u>** up or do the ABC\'s.

##### 2. Philosophy is a failed method used by the world to get people to behave. It comes down to human effort and the futility of stopping the flesh by merely saying no to **<u>sin</u>**. Colossians 2:23

##### 3. Philosophy is the world's **<u>way</u>**, not God's way, of changing people and society. This way of control is very basic like saying,"no" to a child.

##### 4. The unsaved by default live their lives according to philosophy's *empty deception, traditions and elementary principles*. Saved people who walk according to the flesh typically live their lives by these very same principles.

##### 5. This is why Paul so strongly and clearly **<u>rejected</u>** philosophy as an empty substitute for *Christ in you*, God's mystery provision for living a spiritual life. Paul told the Colossian believers to learn to walk by faith, dependent on Christ Jesus.

#### c. Colossians 2:8h -- Finally we are to reject philosophy because of its distorted **<u>shift</u>** in focus. Philosophy is *not according to Christ*.

##### 1. For scores of Christians the logic of philosophy either replaces Christ or **<u>makes</u>** Him too insignificant or insufficient for explaining life or even resolving life's problems. Therefore, as Paul says, philosophy is *not according to Christ*.

##### 2. Philosophy fails **<u>first</u>** and foremost because it diminishes Jesus Christ as the answer and dismisses or displaces Him as inadequate.

##### 3. The fact is, philosophy always disappoints. It leaves you looking for **<u>more</u>**. Yet in Jesus Christ every believer has everything necessary for life and godliness.2 Peter 1:3-4,3:17-18

##### 4. Any time anyone tells you they have the answer to life, if their answer does not lead to Jesus Christ as **<u>able</u>** and adequate, it is mere philosophy and will in the end fail you, guaranteed. Romans 1:21-22

##### 5. Christ is God's one and only treasure chest filled with ***<u>all</u>** wisdom and understanding.* John 10:10, Colossians 2:3

## B.**Colossians 2:9-15 -- Understanding Christ's person and work safeguards against heresy**

### 1. Colossians 2:9-10 -- Understanding Christ as God's provision **<u>guards</u>** us against the heresy of philosophy.

#### a. Colossians 2:9 -- We choose Christ over philosophy because as God incarnate He alone is adequate for every need.*For in Him all the fullness of Deity **<u>dwells</u>***(present tense)*in bodily form*. Colossian 1:19

##### 1. First we should understand that the phrase ***in****<u>Him</u>*** is in an emphatic position in the Greek sentence deepening the contrast we find between Jesus Christ and any substitute.

##### 2. A philosopher may **<u>offer</u>** you superior knowledge, but no one other than Jesus Christ can offer himself as the God-man.

##### 3. The fullness or completeness of Christ communicates to us that ultimately He has all the **<u>answers</u>** to life's perplexities. Fullness is found in no one other than Jesus Christ, so if you want answers to life's questions, look no further. If you trust in philosophy, you will come away disappointed. Romans 9:33b

##### 4. Jesus Christ is superior to any philosophy because He is God come in human flesh, and thankfully He now **<u>abides</u>** forever in us. Colossians 1:28

##### 5. The term *fullness* PLEROMA was originally used by cultic religions to describe the **<u>sum</u>** total of the qualities of their false deity. Eventually under Gnosticism false teachers taught that Jesus Christ was merely one of many stepping-stones or intermediaries leading to *fullness*.

##### 6. Obviously this **<u>error</u>** was an affront to Christ's adequacy for providing us with the abundant life. John 10:10

#### b. Colossians 2:10a --*And in Him you have been **<u>made</u>** complete*. We choose Christ over philosophy because in Him, as His people, we actually lack nothing.

##### 1. This truth ought to be trumpeted all throughout Christendom. Our position in Christ secures for us the blessing of lacking **<u>nothing</u>** necessary for abundant and holy living.

###### a. As we have observed, the verb *complete* PLEROO means to make **<u>full</u>**. The fact that it is in the perfect tense in Greek conveys that although the filling already took place in the past, it has an ongoing effect all the way to the present.

###### b. In other words, we **<u>remain</u>** continually *complete in Him*.

##### 2. Through the **<u>true</u>** knowledge of Jesus Christ, we have all we need for life and godliness. There is no such thing as a second-rate, less-than-complete believer.2 Peter 1:3-4

#### c. Colossians 2:10b -- Why choose Christ over philosophy? Because "*\[Christ\] is the **<u>head</u>** over all rule and authority*."

##### 1. There are **<u>many</u>** supposed authorities that tell you Christ is not sufficient. This verse tells us that Christ is over all the so-called authorities that say such vanities. Wise men can tell you all sorts of lofty falsehoods, but the greatest authority of all, Jesus Christ, has the final word.

##### 2.**<u>Christ</u>** is truly supreme. He alone is over, and not part of, the angelic, or supposed enlightened, realm. As God, He is Creator, and as man, He is the firstborn, the premiere man of all time.

##### 3. Christ is supreme beyond measure, above all authorities whether angelic or human; so don't look to human philosophy or anyone who **<u>claims</u>** to have the answers. Look to Christ alone and allow His Word to abundantly dwell within you. Colossians 3:16

### 2. Colossians 2:11-13a -- We ought to understand how our identification with Christ and not philosophy gives us true **<u>victory</u>** over the sin nature.

#### a. Colossians 2:11a --*And in Him...* Notice the use of the phrase *in Him* in this verse. This statement reminds us all over again of our identification with Jesus Christ. All believers are positionally **<u>found</u>** in Christ: *in Him*. Ephesians 1:3

#### b. Colossians 2:11b --***You were also circumcised** with a circumcision made without hands...* By means of a spiritual operation **<u>done</u>** in you at the moment of your salvation, you now have true spiritual freedom from domination by your flesh.

##### 1. Physical circumcision separated the Israelite nation from other nations, making it unique, set **<u>apart</u>** unto God. In this physical surgery there was a cutting away of unnecessary skin, a separation in the flesh of the physical body.

##### 2. We recall that physical circumcision was a **<u>sign</u>** of the covenant between God and Abraham and between God and Abraham's physical descendants.

##### 3. We know from Scripture that physical circumcision has never been a requirement for Christians for either salvation or sanctification, but spiritually speaking **<u>every</u>** Christian has been circumcised. Philippians 3:3

#### c. Colossians 2:11c --*You were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands*. At salvation we **<u>had</u>** the spiritual operation of circumcision done in us. Here we understand Paul to be talking about the nonliteral circumcision that is true of every believer and occurs at the moment of salvation. Romans 2:29

##### 1.*You were also circumcised*... The believer's circumcision is given as a **<u>fact</u>**.

##### 2.*...with a circumcision made without hands*. We can see that it was done **<u>without</u>** human doctors.

###### a. Grammatically this circumcision is in the passive **<u>voice</u>** showing that it was done to the believer and not by the believer.

###### b. Since this is said to be true of **<u>all</u>** believers and was done without human hands, we conclude that it is **spiritual circumcision** done by God at the point of salvation.

#### d. Colossians 2:11d --***In the removal** of the body of the flesh*... What happened in this circumcision and what is its significance? The flesh, or our **<u>sin</u>** nature, was surgically severed from us and will eventually be destroyed. The Great Physician did this great work.

##### 1. The word *removal* APEKDUSIS in Greek is a noun which means to wholly put aside. This word was used to describe something set aside **<u>never</u>** to be used again -- like one might do with a worn out garment.

##### 2. The word *removal* connotes separation but **<u>not</u>** obliteration or eradication.

##### 3. In circumcision, the flesh of the foreskin is surgically severed from the human body and laid **<u>aside</u>**. Later this piece of flesh is discarded.

##### 4. In spiritual circumcision, the sin nature was severed, losing **<u>direct</u>** connection to us. Eventually in the rapture when our bodies are changed forever, the sin nature that was cut off at salvation will be completely eliminated.

##### 5. For now we are to understand that the sin nature's direct impact and effect in our **<u>lives</u>** has been cut off. This is of great significance and is another way of affirming Romans 6:2,6,10-11.

#### e. Colossians 2:11e --*In the removal **of the body of the flesh***... In the Scriptures, the word for body SOMA normally refers to the actual physical human body, yet this is obviously **not** saying our **<u>human</u>** body was removed or laid aside.

##### 1. A secondary meaning of the word body SOMA is the **substance or [core</u>** of an object in contrast to its **shadow or silhouette**. This is the meaning Paul used here.

##### 2. In verse 17 there is an example of Paul using this secondary meaning of **<u>body</u>** SOMA.*Things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the **substance*** SOMA *belongs to Christ.*

##### 3. The phrase *body of the flesh* then refers to the fleshly **<u>nature</u>** within us that was circumcised, disconnected and laid aside by means of *the circumcision of Christ* when Christ was cut off from life in His death on the cross.

##### 4. From Romans 6:11 we know that as we reckon by faith on this fact we can enjoy freedom from the flesh's tyranny. Because of spiritual circumcision, the flesh has lost its **<u>rights</u>** to control us.

#### f. Colossians 2:11f --*By the circumcision of Christ*... The flesh was rendered powerless over us when Christ was killed, or cut off, on the **<u>cross</u>**. Romans 6:6

##### 1. In the NIV the phrase *the circumcision of Christ* is rendered the circumcision done by Christ. This translation does not **<u>fit</u>** the passive grammar of the Greek structure.

##### 2. The phrase *by the circumcision of Christ* refers to the death of Christ on the **<u>cross</u>** as the context confirms. The next verse confirms this interpretation, speaking about His burial and resurrection and our relationship to it. Daniel 9:26

##### 3. The **<u>glory</u>** of the cross is that the work of Christ not only deals with our sins (plural); it also deals with our sin (singular), also referred to as the sin nature, the flesh or the fleshly nature. Romans 6:9-10

###### a. When we were crucified together with Christ, direct **<u>access</u>** by our sinful flesh to our hearts and lives was surgically severed. Galatians 2:20

###### b. The flesh (sin nature) was not immediately destroyed, but its direct line of access to us was instantly severed, or cut **<u>off</u>**.

###### c. God has separated from us our sin nature's right to freely **<u>govern</u>** in our mortal bodies. Romans 6:12

##### 4.*By the circumcision of Christ*... Now, because of this spiritual surgery done to us by God at salvation we do not have to obey the sin nature's desires nor **<u>yield</u>** to its authority. This victory became ours through our being co-crucified with Christ. Romans 6:6-7

#### g. Colossians 2:12a -- The benefit of your co-death and co-burial with Christ is the simple fact that **you don't have to kill the flesh. You are [already</u> dead to it.**

##### 1. Colossians 2:12a --*Having been buried with Him in baptism*... When Christ was cut off from **<u>life</u>**(circumcision) in His death on the cross, we died together with Him and we were also co-entombed with Him.

###### a.*Having been buried...* Here again we see the passive voice in the Greek in regard to our baptism **<u>into</u>** His death. This is something done to the believer by God and not something done by the believer.

###### b. Romans 6:3-5 shows our identification with the person of Christ as being absolutely **<u>real</u>** in the mind of God.

###### c. At the **<u>moment</u>** of salvation we were placed into Jesus Christ and eternally identified with Him in both his death and burial. Romans 6:8; Galatians 2:20; Colossians 2:20,3:3

########### d. Because of this fact, God counts us as **<u>dead</u>** to the sin nature and alive unto God in Christ. Our sin nature is not dead, but in our co-crucifixion with Christ the fleshly nature's direct line of control and influence was slashed. Romans 6:2,7

##### 2. Baptism is of great spiritual significance since it is an **<u>act</u>** of identification.

###### a. In the ancient world with all its initiation rites, it was very important to the Spirit of God to **<u>make</u>** a clarification here.

###### b. The mystery cults like the Gnostics and the ancient Essenes practiced baptisms or ceremonial washings as part of becoming an enlightened or devoted **<u>follower</u>**.

###### c. What Colossians 2:12 shows is that in Christ, and with Christ, we have received a spiritual baptism (identification) that spiritually speaking **<u>placed</u>** us in the tomb together with Christ.

###### d. Christ's death has become **<u>our</u>** death. Often well-meaning Christians say things like,"You need to die," or "You need to crucify yourself," instead of saying,"You should now enjoy your positional standing as one who has already died with Christ." Colossians 2:20

###### e. These are two very different concepts: one is based on **<u>human</u>** effort and striving to become dead, and the other is based on faith in the fact that God already united us with Christ in His cross, tomb and resurrection.

###### f. You should consider the following.

###### i. When a Christian is baptized in water, he is reenacting as a public testimony the spiritual **<u>fact</u>** that he was already placed into the death, burial and resurrection of Christ at the moment he believed.

####### ii. The Holy Spirit baptized you into Christ at the precise **<u>instant</u>** of your faith in Christ alone for salvation. Galatians 3:27,1 Corinthians 12:13

#### h. Colossians 2:12b --*In which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead*. One of the greatest benefits of our co-resurrection with Christ is that we now have the **<u>power</u>** to live the abundant life.

##### 1. Colossians 2:12b --*In which you were also **<u>raised</u>** up with Him*... We were raised up with Christ so as to live life in a new or distinctive way. Romans 6:4b,11

###### a.*You were also **<u>raised</u>** up with Him...* Here we have an aorist passive indicative verb. The aorist tense stresses that it already occurred at a specific point in time. The indicative mood gives an emphatic sense to the action. And the passive voice means it was something done to the believer rather than by the believer.

###### b.*Raised up with Him*... We are now alive from the dead in Christ. Our former state of being dead in sin and dead to God has **<u>changed</u>**. We now possess Christ's life and as a result are alive unto God. Colossians 2:11, John 6:40, Ephesians 2:4-6, Colossians 3:1,2 Corinthians 5:14-17

##### 2. Colossians 2:12c -- Our death, burial and resurrection with Christ occurred ...*through **<u>faith</u>** in the working of God who raised Him from the dead*.

###### a.**<u>God</u>** was the actor here. The moment you were saved, God identified you with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection.

###### b. The very **<u>power</u>** that raised Jesus Christ from the dead is the power that raised us up together with Him so that we are able now to serve in the supernatural energy of the Holy Spirit. Ephesians 1:19-20

###### c. When God included us in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ in this way, we were given the amazing gift of a **<u>new</u>** way of life that included liberation from absolute obedience to the sin nature.

#### i. Colossians 2:13 -- Paul next summarized verses 11-12, emphasizing once again these positional **<u>truths</u>**.

##### 1. Colossians 2:13a -- Let's look at the two senses in which we were **<u>dead</u>**. Remember that biblical death does not mean non-existence. It means separation.

###### a.*When you were dead in your transgressions*. We were dead to God because of our willful **<u>sins</u>**.

###### b.*When you were dead in ... the uncircumcision of your flesh*. We were also dead to God because of our direct attachment to the sin **<u>nature</u>**.

###### i. We were dead in the sense that we were detached from God who is the source and **<u>giver</u>** of life.

###### ii. In our natural condition of spiritual uncircumcision, we were hopelessly captive to the **<u>flesh</u>**.

###### iii. Thankfully those terrible problems were resolved when we were made **<u>alive</u>** in Christ.

##### 2. Colossians 2:13b --*He made you alive together with Him*. God be praised that we are now **<u>alive</u>** with Christ.

###### a. As part of our salvation package, in our identification with Christ God the Father made us **<u>alive</u>** together with Christ. This positional truth describes our new identity in Christ.

###### b. We are now God's new creation. We have been created, or made alive in, the **<u>person</u>** of Jesus Christ.2 Corinthians 5:14-21, Ephesians 4:23

### 3.**Colossians 2:13-15 -- Christ, not philosophy, gives us freedom from [guilt</u>.**

#### a. Colossians 2:13c -- Christ disposed of our **<u>sins</u>** and our consuming guilt.*Having forgiven us all our transgressions*.

##### 1.*Having **<u>forgiven</u>** us*... Paul rejoiced in the completed nature of our comprehensive forgiveness.1 John 2:12

###### a. The unbeliever is never told to **<u>ask</u>** for forgiveness of sins in order to be saved. Acts 16:31

###### b. On the contrary, the unbeliever is promised forgiveness of sins if he will simply **<u>believe</u>** on the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 10:43,13:39

##### 2.***<u>All</u>** our transgressions*... Paul highlighted the comprehensive nature of God's forgiveness, emphasizing ***ALL** our transgressions*, not merely some of them. Micah 7:18-19, Psalm 103:12

##### 3.*All **our** transgressions*... Paul rejoiced in the personal nature of God's forgiveness when he included himself and his **own** personal sins in the phrase *all **<u>our</u>** transgressions*. Ephesians 4:32

##### 4.*All our **transgressions***... Paul recognized our **<u>sins</u>** for what they really are -- transgressions. A transgression is a deliberate and willful overstepping of the boundary, a blatant disregard for God's righteous standards. Of course, this statement highlights the personal need for forgiveness. Romans 4:7

######## b. Colossians 2:14a --*Having **<u>canceled</u>** out the certificate of debt...* Christ, not philosophy, discarded the certificate of debt that was held against us.

##### 1. The believer's sin **<u>debt</u>** has been *cancelled out* EXALEIPHO. The verb *cancelled out* EXALEIPHO means to wipe off, to expunge or to obliterate.

##### 2. This was made possible because the perfect Lord Jesus died as our substitute. The accusations that were against us were placed to **<u>His</u>** account and therefore our debts are gone forever.

#### c. Colossians 2:14b --*...the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us*... In New Testament days when someone was crucified, a notice was often attached above the **<u>head</u>** of the criminal delineating the crimes that had been committed.

##### 1. Such signs were designed to show the legitimacy of the **<u>death</u>** penalty.

##### 2. In the mind of God, the list of **<u>crimes</u>** that were against us was nailed to the cross of Christ.

##### 3. On the cross, Christ died for the crimes **<u>we</u>** committed so that the list of sins that denounced us could be blotted out forever.

#### d. Colossians 2:14c --*He has **<u>taken</u>** it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.* Christ's death, not philosophy, took every decree against us out of the way and acquitted us of all charges.

##### 1. The Greek verb for *taken out* AIRO is in the perfect tense. This structure indicates that God took all the decrees against you out of the way at a specific point in time, namely at the point you put your **<u>faith</u>** in Christ, with results extending all the way to the present time.

##### 2. This verse gives us the clear understanding that our future judgment will not be for **<u>sins</u>**. Our certificate of debt has been taken away. Because Christ was already judged for our sins, we will not be judged for our sins in the future. John 3:18

##### 3. Thank God for the cross of Christ where our **sin** debt was paid in full. Romans 8:34

#### e. Colossians 2:15 -- Christ, not philosophy, disarmed **<u>Satan</u>** and his demons.

##### 1. Colossians 2:15a --*When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities*. Here we find another accomplishment of the cross of Christ. Christ triumphed **<u>over</u>** Satan, having defeated him by His cross and subsequent resurrection.

###### a. We know that in the cross we have forgiveness of **<u>sins</u>**(plural).1 Corinthians 15:3-4

###### b. We also know that in the cross God **<u>cut</u>** free all direct control the sin nature had over us through the enactment of a spiritual circumcision. Colossians 2:11; Romans 6:10

###### c. What we may not know is that in the cross Christ also made Satan\'s absolute **<u>power</u>** over us ineffective. John 12:31; 1 Corinthians 15:23-26; Ephesians 1:20-22,3:10; Colossians 2:15; 1 Peter 3:22

###### i. When the text says Christ *disarmed* APEKDUOMAI *the rulers and authorities*, it literally means He stripped them off as when a person quickly **<u>removes</u>** clothing.

###### ii.*Disarmed***APEK**DUOMAI has a double prefix APO **away from** and EK **out from**, which powerfully and meaningfully highlights the **<u>depth</u>** of the Christ's disarmament of Satan.

###### iii. The cross work of Christ spelled **<u>doom</u>** for all the rulers and authorities, especially Satan, since with great gusto and passion Christ victoriously hurled them off.

##### 2. Colossians 2:15b --*He made a public display of them.* Christ made a **<u>public</u>** spectacle of Satan and his demons by triumphing over them in His cross. Scripture often uses this metaphor for triumph. The metaphor depicts the return of a general after an overwhelming victory. Ephesians 4:8-11

###### a. The **<u>Romans</u>** in particular, whenever they returned from war, would parade their enemies by herding them chained in the rear of their military precession.2 Corinthians 2:14-16

###### b. From Roman literature we know of **<u>four</u>** important criteria that had to be met for a conquering general to receive a celebrated triumphal entry upon his return to Rome.

###### i. The Roman general had to be the actual victor. He could not **<u>claim</u>** victory for another. He had to personally be in command on the battlefield when the wars were actually fought and won.

###### ii. The military campaign could not be a mere **<u>partial</u>** victory. His victory had to be an overwhelming success. A triumphant entry was never enacted for victories in civil wars or for repelling invaders.

###### iii. There was also a numeric requirement for a triumphal entry parade. The army over which a general presided must have killed at least **<u>5,000</u>** enemy combatants during the campaign.

###### iv. The military campaign had to have **<u>added</u>** significant new territories to the Roman Empire.

###### c. Obviously Christ's **<u>victory</u>** was much greater than any Roman general's victory, since His success was against the greatest enemy of all time, Satan. Hebrews 9:26

###### d. In Christ we are considered to be **<u>more</u>** than conquers. This is a positional honor given to every believer at the point of salvation. Romans 8:37,1 John 5:4-5

##### 3. Colossians 2:15c -- How did God make a public display of His enemies? He did this,*having triumphed over them through***<u>Christ</u>**.

###### a. What might have seemed to be the **<u>demise</u>** of God's plans, and even God's King, actually became the greatest victory heaven and earth has ever known.1 Corinthians 2:8

###### b. By means of the cross, God conquered **<u>Satan</u>** and all demonic foes. Everything that stood in the way of our salvation was soundly defeated.

###### c. The just died for the unjust, therefore *the accuser of the brethren* has **<u>no</u>** case against us.1 Peter 3:18, Revelation 12:10

## C.**Colossians 2:16 -- Legalism, the second heresy**

### 1. What is **<u>legalism</u>**?

#### a. Legalism among the **<u>unsaved</u>**. Galatians 2:16; Acts 15:1,8-11

##### 1. This is the mental attitude of the false believer who seeks to **<u>earn</u>** or merit salvation by religious rituals, human efforts or good works. Most cults, and virtually all religions, practice a form of legalism. Galatians 2:4

##### 2. When anyone **<u>adds</u>** good works as a prerequisite or requirement for salvation to what Christ has already accomplished, they are guilty of legalism. Philippians 3:2-3

##### 3. Legalistic unbelievers think,"Since I have done (fill in the blank) God now **<u>owes</u>** me salvation."

#### b. Legalism among the **<u>saved</u>**. Acts 15:5,11-13; Galatians 2:4-5,16,3:3-5,4:21-31

##### 1. This refers to the believer who seeks to earn or merit God's acceptance or **<u>blessing</u>** by religious rituals, human efforts, or through the fulfillment of requirements.

##### 2. Legalists feel that progressive sanctification is based on their works and human **<u>efforts</u>** rather than on the grace of God through a walk of faith in Christ.

#####3. Legalistic Christians say,"Since I have done (fill in the blank), God now **<u>owes</u>** me blessings."

#### c. Consider the following in relation to legalism. Galatians 5:4, Philippians 3:1-9

##### 1. Whether it is for salvation or for sanctification, a legalist becomes captivated with human determination and doing good works to **<u>merit</u>** God's help or blessing. Matthew 7:22-23

##### 2. Legalistic Christians are **<u>proud</u>**. They have not understood that they cannot please God by human effort. Romans 7:18

##### 3. A legalist is captivated with himself rather than with **<u>Christ</u>**. His eyes are always on himself and his performance rather than on Christ and His adequacy. Legalists compare themselves with others. Galatians 5:15,25-26

##### 4. Legalistic Christians do not rest **<u>solely</u>** on Christ's enabling power for living the Christian life; they feel they need to do their part.2 Corinthians 3:4-6,5:7; Galatians 3:3,2:20

##### 5. Some people contend that if they do **<u>not</u>** live by laws, principles, or rules they will end up sinning.

###### a. The irony of this is that those who live by law with its rules and regulations, actually **<u>arouse</u>** the sin nature to break the very rules they have set up for holy living. Romans 6:14; 7:5; 8-9,11; 1 Corinthians 15:56

###### b. Legalism actually moves the believer **<u>away</u>** from spiritual growth rather than closer to it. Galatians 5:4

##### 6. In your present standing in Christ you have **<u>all</u>** of Christ's abundance at your disposal. You are to walk by faith in Him. Colossians 2:3,6,10; John 15:4-5

### 2. Colossians 2:16 -- Paul initiated his corrections aimed at the heresy of legalism by first teaching the Colossians to not **<u>allow</u>** anyone *...to act as \[their\] judge.*

#### a. Colossians 2:16a -- Paul commanded them to not fall prey to legalists with their judgmental **<u>spirit</u>**.

##### 1. This command to *not* let others ...*act, as your judge* KRINETO is a present tense imperative. The present tense indicates that this type of judging was happening at the **<u>moment</u>** Paul wrote. The believers were told to stop letting others interfere or referee in their lives. Romans 14:3

##### 2. Legalists always possess a judgmental spirit. Their austere and ungracious demeanor will not only **<u>crush</u>** your spirit but will lead you to error. If you fall into their ways, you will lose a faith-based intimate walk with the Lord and replace it with an unfruitful burdensome life of dos and don'ts. Galatians 5:15,25-26

#### b. Colossians 2:16b --*Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food*... A legalist gets judgmental and demanding about your **<u>private</u>** life. Eating *food* is one of the most basic functions of life and the legalist wants to control it. Romans 14:1-4, Mark 7:5-23,1 Timothy 4:3-4

##### 1. Legalists lead you to believe that what you eat is of **<u>extreme</u>****spiritual** significance. Legalists will tell you what you must or must not eat. They will control your diet, which biblically is none of their business. Romans 14:23

##### 2. Paul predicted that in the last days the world would be fraught with **<u>food</u>** restrictions.1 Timothy 4:3-4

##### 3. Do you have people trying to control your diet by telling you their way of eating is more spiritual or that it is the **<u>right</u>** way? Matthew 15:11,15-20; Luke 7:34

#### c. Colossians 2:16c --*Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to*...*drink*. While the Bible condemns drunkenness, the legalist wants to make what you drink a **<u>spiritual</u>** issue. Ephesians 5:18

##### 1. Romans 14:17 shows that the future kingdom of God is **<u>not</u>** about eating and drinking, implying that we should modulate our rhetoric accordingly.

##### 2. Jesus said that it is not what you take into your body that defiles you but rather what comes **<u>out</u>** of your heart. Matthew 15:17-20

##### 3.1 Corinthians 10:31 says that in all you eat or drink, do all to the **<u>glory</u>** of God.

#### d. Colossians 2:16d --*Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard ...to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day*. Legalists not only get judgmental and demanding about what you eat, they also make demands on how you **<u>worship</u>**. Romans 14:5-6,10

##### 1.*Festivals* were the **<u>holy</u>** days and feast days that Moses set forth in the Law. Galatians 4:9-11

###### a. This is not referring to **<u>holidays</u>** or national observances celebrated in your country.

###### b. This is referring to days observed by the religious establishment. It is referring to days that all so-called Christians have "**<u>always</u>**" observed.

###### c. Legalists believe that by observing these **<u>days</u>** they are being good people. They think that they please God by observing certain days and may judge you for not doing so, or for observing other days. Legalists always obligate you to do the same things they do.

##### 2. Paul also mentioned *New **<u>Moon</u>*** celebrations that legalists wanted to require. Isaiah 1:10-15

###### a. The New Moon was an elaborate religious **<u>day</u>** in Israel. Special sacrifices were made at that time.

###### b. Historically a New Moon day would set the month's calendar of religious activities in **<u>Israel</u>**.

###### c. On a New Moon celebration all work would be suspended and no private or public **<u>feasts</u>** or festivals were allowed.

###### d. Religious legalists delight in **<u>imposing</u>** these types of religious observances on your life.

##### 3. Paul included a mention of ***<u>Sabbath</u>** days*. Legalists love to obligate Christians to observe their particular idea of a Sabbath day custom. Exodus 20:8-11

###### a. According to the Mosaic **<u>Law</u>**, the Sabbath was a day to be faithfully remembered by national Israel.

###### b. Failure to faithfully observe the Sabbath was supposed to result in the **<u>death</u>** penalty. Exodus 31:14-15

###### c. This law was never instituted for the **<u>church</u>**, although even today legalists seek to enslave uninformed believers in a form of Sabbath observance.

#### e. In summary, we should note that all five elements of legalism mentioned in verse 16 had their **<u>source</u>** in Judaism. Obviously legalistic Judaism was one of the heretical teachings disrupting the church of Colossae.

## D.**Colossians 2:17 -- How to safeguard yourself against the heresy of legalism**

### 1. Colossians 2:17 -- In order to not fall victim to legalism you need to understand the **<u>main</u>** problem with legalism.

#### a. Colossians 2:17a --*Things which are a mere shadow of what is to come.* Legalism is captivated with **<u>hollow</u>** or empty substitutes for real fellowship with the Lord.

##### 1. Legalism is like an infatuation with the **<u>shadow</u>** or reflection of an object rather than with the object itself.

##### 2. If you get caught up in observing the things detailed in verse 16, you will be focused on the shadows of Christ previewed in ancient Judaism and not on the actual **<u>person</u>** of Christ as revealed in the New Testament.

##### 3. This could be compared to a photograph of a loved one who is far from home. Although the photograph **<u>reminds</u>** you of your loved one, it is not your loved one. Imagine hugging the photograph after your loved one's return. That would be foolish.

##### 4. Legalism is that kind of cheap substitute for a **<u>real</u>** and intimate relationship with Christ. Legalists become fixed on principles, rules and traditions they find in Scripture rather than on Christ Himself. Galatians 3:24-25

#### b. Colossians 2:17b --*But the substance* SOMA *belongs to Christ...* Freedom, versus the slavery of legalism, is found in Christ. Christ is the **<u>real</u>** substance; legalism on the other hand is external and only dimly reflective of Christ.

##### 1. Are you having fellowship with the person of Christ or are you simply going through the motions of religion? Are you doing church or are you enjoying fellowship with Christ?

##### 2. To safeguard from legalism, do not allow anyone to become your **<u>judge</u>** and put you on a guilt trip by getting into the minutia of your personal or spiritual life.

## E.**Colossians 2:18-19a -- Mysticism, the third heresy**

### 1. Colossians 2:18 -- Let's discern the dangers of mysticism.

#### a. Colossians 2:18a --*Let no **one**...* Paul again started this section by **<u>warning</u>** believers against external control and manipulation. The heresy of mysticism typically has a charismatic and controlling leader who **claims** to have supernatural power, extraordinary faith, or the sign gifts.

#### b. Colossians 2:18b --***Let** no one **keep defrauding you***... The phrase *let no one keep \[on\] defrauding you* is a **<u>present</u>** tense imperative in Greek. The use of this verb tense indicates that this was a very present danger in Colossae. You too could succumb to this error, so you also should heed this command.

#### c. Colossians 2:18c --*Let no one keep defrauding you **of your prize***... Paul commanded the Colossian believers to not tolerate interventions by anyone who might act as judge or referee and somehow **<u>cheat</u>** them from true victory.

##### 1.*Defraud* is the word KATABRABEUO composed of KATA **against** and BRABEUO **line-[judge</u>** or **referee**. The use of this word implies that a referee might make an unfair call resulting in your loss.

##### 2. Although the phrase *of your prize* is not found explicitly in the **<u>Greek</u>** text, the idea of disqualification is implied in the word *defraud*.

##### 3. With its focus on experiences, the heresy of mysticism stealthily presents itself under a guise of spirituality while in reality **<u>robbing</u>** you of all spiritual progress.

#### d. Colossians 2:18e --*Let no one keep defrauding you*...*by delighting in...* Mysticism will put an arbitrator between you and Jesus Christ. Defrauded of Jesus, you'll delight yourself in the **<u>wrong</u>** things.

### 2. Colossians 2:18f-19a -- Let's look at **<u>six</u>** aspects of the heresy of mysticism in which a believer might misguidedly take delight.

#### a. Colossians 2:18f --**Aspect 1**: Typically the heresy of mysticism comes with a guru or spiritual leader who will ultimately *defraud you of your **<u>prize</u>** by delighting in **self-abasement***-- your self-abasement not his.

##### 1. The heresy of mysticism often hosts a supposed spiritual leader who mesmerizes and **<u>controls</u>** unguarded believers.

##### 2. Leaders in the heresy of mysticism tend to glory in their great humility and alleged **<u>inside</u>** track with God. They go to great lengths to explain their spiritual exploits and experiences.

##### 3. In this error the leader typically grabs the spotlight from Christ and the **<u>flock</u>** unwittingly follows him, being drug **away from the Lord**. Acts 20:30

##### 4. Because of their delight with *self-abasement* they will usually require extreme submission from their followers. In their quest for supernatural power or miraculous experiences they often subject their followers to **<u>engage</u>** in debasing or humiliating actions.

##### 5. If you have a tendency toward mysticism you will likely believe that humility, or self-abasement, is the **<u>secret</u>** to spirituality. Sadly, over time this heresy disconnects believers from Christ as the source of strength for their life.

##### 6. Under mysticism you become **<u>guilty</u>** of replacing reality in your fellowship with Christ with a fixation on experiences like supposedly seeing angels, having visions, or other supernatural achievements.

##### 7. As an outcome, you will see yourself negatively. You will consider yourself unworthy, being forced into the humility of ***self-abasement***. You might **<u>feel</u>** obligated to fast, spend long hours in prayer, practice overnight vigils, kneel, or let yourself be hit in the face or pushed down.2 Corinthians 11:20

##### 8. Contrary to being forced into humiliation consider the following:

###### a. In the church, pastors and elders are called to tenderly shepherd the **<u>flock</u>** of God. In shepherding, there must not to be heavy-handed control or forced submission.1 Peter 5:2-4,3 John 9-10

###### b. Since ***self-abasement*** is presented here in a negative light, it is obviously not speaking of **<u>true</u>** humility. True humility is seen in James 4:6 where *God resists the proud but gives grace to the **humble*** and in 1 Peter 5:6 where God says,"***Humble yourselves** under the mighty hand of God*."

#### b. Colossians 2:18g --**Aspect 2**: Don't let anyone defraud you by *...the worship of angels*. The heresy of mysticism misdirects believers into an unhealthy obsession with **<u>angels</u>**, whether good or bad (demons).1 Timothy 4:1-2

##### 1. According to the **<u>false</u>** teaching already taught in Paul's day, and even more so later under Gnosticism, celestial beings were said to be part of the fullness needed to reach God.

##### 2. This heresy opens one up to thinking he needs **<u>angels</u>** or other supernatural intermediaries to approach God or navigate through life.

#### c. Colossians 2:18h --**Aspect 3**: Don't let anyone defraud you by *...taking his stand on visions he has seen*... The heresy of mysticism teaches that supernatural or ecstatic experiences such as visions are the **<u>basis</u>**, or measure, of true spirituality.

##### 1. Under this error, undue emphasis gets placed on experiences. Experiences can become more important to you than the truth of God's **<u>Word</u>**.

##### 2. Leaders who are mystical will go on and on about spiritual experiences they have had in order to demonstrate their **<u>claim</u>** to superior spiritual power and authority.

##### 3. The phrase *taking **his** stand* EMBATEOU came to be a special **<u>term</u>** used by mystery cults to describe the initiation process required to enter the inner circle of their false religion. It is interesting that the Holy Spirit had Paul use a word common to mysticism to expose their error.

#### d. Colossians 2:18i --**Aspect 4**: Don't let anyone who is ...*inflated **<u>without</u>** cause...* defraud you. The heresy of mysticism inspires spiritual arrogance.

##### 1.*Inflated without cause* is being full of hot **<u>air</u>**. It is spiritual pride.

##### 2. Mysticism claims **<u>humility</u>** while actually being nothing more than repulsive pride.

#### e. Colossians 2:18j --**Aspect 5**: Don't let anyone defraud you since that individual would simply be ...*inflated**without cause **by his fleshly mind***. The heresy of mysticism is characterized by the **<u>fleshly</u>** mind being in control of the individual.

##### 1. The phrase *by his fleshly mind* shows that the heresy of mysticism is nothing more than a work of the **<u>flesh</u>**.

##### 2. Mysticism creates a disconnection with Christ and allows the *fleshly mind* rather than the Lord to **<u>control</u>** the individual or the church.

#### f. Colossians 2:19a --**Aspect 6**: Don't let anyone defraud you by *...not holding fast to the head*... The ultimate peril of the error of mysticism is that it generates a detachment from the **<u>headship</u>** of Jesus Christ.

##### 1. In its essence, this heresy creates a distance between **<u>Christ</u>** and His church or Christ and the individual. Christ is there, but He is not directing. Christ becomes superseded by the pseudo-spirituality of a charismatic leader.

##### 2.*And not holding fast* KRATEO... is a **<u>present</u>** tense participle stressing the immediate necessity to hold tightly to Christ. In Acts 24:6 the same word for *hold fast* KRATEO is used of the Jews who tightly seized Paul in the temple, firmly gripping him without relaxing.

##### 3. Here Paul used the term *holding fast* KRATEO figuratively to communicate intensity and describe the **<u>peril</u>** the church could experience if it did not hold its head, Jesus Christ, with a tight grip.

##### 4. The truth is that if we do not consistently hold tightly to the head of the church, Jesus Christ, we will ultimately **<u>lose</u>** that necessary and vital link with Him and fall victim to mysticism. Galatians 5:4b

## F.**Colossians 2:19b -- How to safeguard against the heresy of mysticism**

### 1. Colossians 2:19b -- We are to consistently *hold fast* to our one true **<u>head</u>**, Jesus Christ, and reject the heresy of mysticism.

### 2. Colossians 2:19c --*From whom the **<u>entire</u>** body...*

#### a. Christ is the one and **<u>only</u>** head of the body. Ephesians 5:23

#### b. Obviously we might live just fine without a hand or foot, but we cannot live without a head. Our head houses our brain, which controls all the functions of the body. Even the air, food and water that **<u>sustain</u>** our health enter our body through the head by way of the mouth. We need our head!

#### c. In like **<u>manner</u>**, we cannot live spiritually without our head, Jesus Christ, who constantly supplies us with all we need for life and godliness. We need Christ, not some alleged super-spiritual expert.

### 3. Colossians 2:19d --*...being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments\...*

#### a. As individual members of Christ's body, we are to walk in unity and love so that we **<u>build</u>** each other up. Ephesians 4:16

#### b. Christ is the only head; all the **<u>rest</u>** of us are members of His body. Instead of each part paying homage to or serving some so-called gifted leader the individual parts all contribute to the well-being of the whole for the glory of the head, Jesus Christ.

### 4. Colossians 2:19e -- The entire body ...*grows with a growth, which is from God*. True spiritual **<u>growth</u>** comes from God alone and not from some mysterious phenomena or mystical experience. We do not look to those things or to individuals who make great claims in that way.

#### a.**<u>God</u>**, not some person, is the only true agent of growth. Colossians 2:7

#### b. Although God uses His Word, Bible teachers, and fellow believers,**<u>God</u>** is the ultimate cause of all true spiritual growth.1 Corinthians 3:6-7, Ephesians 4:11-16

## G. Colossians 2:20-23--Asceticism, the fourth heresy

### 1. What is asceticism?

#### a. Asceticism is erroneous teaching that suggests that self-**<u>denial</u>**, self-discipline and self-restraint are keys to sanctification. This error suggests that in order to be holy you simply need to dominate the body.

#### b. This error concludes that the human **<u>body</u>** is the root problem standing in the way of our godliness. Therefore self-inflicted pain, harsh controls and deprivations to the body are needed to achieve holiness.

### 2. Colossians 2:20 -- Paul sharply dismissed the usefulness of asceticism in making us **<u>holy</u>** by turning the reader to identification truth. Let's look at **four** quick arguments against asceticism found in this one verse. All Paul's answers stem from the positional truth of being dead with Christ to the world. Galatians 6:14

#### a. Colossians 2:20a --*If you have died*...**First** Paul made it clear that asceticism does not work for holiness because we are **<u>dead</u>** people. Are you aware that you are dead with Christ and what that means practically?

##### 1. This if statement is a **<u>first</u>** class condition in the Greek language. In this context we could understand it as "if you have died, and for the sake of argument let's assume that you did indeed die."

##### 2. At salvation God identified us with the death of Christ on the **<u>cross</u>**. Galatians 2:20, Romans 6:5-6, Colossians 3:3

##### 3. What are some of the things we know to be true of us now because of our identity in Christ?

###### a. We know we died with Christ to the **<u>world</u>**. Galatians 6:14

###### b. We know we died with Christ to domination by the sin **<u>nature</u>**. Romans 6:2,6,7,10; Galatians 5:24

###### c. We know we died with Christ to the **<u>power</u>** and control of the devil. Hebrews 2:14-15, Colossians 2:15

###### d. We know we died with Christ to the **<u>law</u>** and its jurisdiction. Romans 7:4-6, Galatians 2:19,1 Corinthians 9:20

###### e. We also know we died with Christ to the burden of ongoing **<u>guilt</u>** since our sins, never to be recalled again, were nailed to the cross with Him. Colossians 2:13-14

##### 4. Why did Paul use our position of being dead with Christ to explain why asceticism is not for the believer?

###### a. Paul stated that practicing asceticism is of no value because **<u>pain</u>** has no effect on the dead. Asceticism with its self-inflicted harshness is of no value in making one who has died with Christ holy.

###### b. It would be foolish to **<u>yell</u>** at a dead person saying,"Do not handle. Do not taste. Do not touch." So it is with those in Christ who are dead to sin.

##### 5. It is important for us to understand the vast difference between the self-effort of crucifying yourself and recognizing by faith your position of **<u>already</u>** having been crucified by God at salvation. Romans 6:6, Galatians 2:20

###### a. Matthew 16:24-26 -- When Jesus said to deny yourself, take up your cross and follow Him, He was not saying to **<u>beat</u>** the body into subjection to produce righteous living. He was speaking of not preserving our lives as Peter had just suggested (vv.21-23).

###### b.1 Corinthians 9:26-27 -- When Paul stated that he disciplined his **<u>body</u>**, it was not a slip-up where he suddenly fell into asceticism. He was talking about not pampering the flesh but rather by faith through the Spirit putting to death the deeds of the body. Romans 8:13, Colossians 3:5

###### c. Galatians 5:22-23 -- Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit produced in the believer who is walking by **<u>faith</u>** and not equal in any way to the self-domination of Christians who promote asceticism.

#### b. Colossians 2:20b --*If you died with Christ **to the elementary principles of the [world</u>***... A **second** reason not to practice asceticism is because it is based on the world's simplistic, or elementary, way of achieving morality.

##### 1.*The elementary principles* STOICHEIA *of the world* refers to the rudimentary, primary, or **<u>basic</u>** prescriptions the world imposes on society in order to enforce conformity. It is the world\'s method of controlling fleshly desires and indulgences.

##### 2. Typically going **<u>back</u>** to the *elementary principles of the world* becomes the method that out-of-control worldly Christians enthusiastically employ.

##### 3. On the contrary, we need to **<u>daily</u>** be reminded of our position in Christ as dead to sin and alive unto God. This will keep us from the frustration and ineffectiveness of asceticism in generating a true change of conduct. Romans 6:17-18

#### c. Colossians 2:20c -- Why,*as if living in the world*... A **third** reason we reject asceticism is because we understand **<u>our</u>** heavenly position in Christ and the fact that we are not part of this cosmic system. This helps avoid worldly, simplistic methods for controlling people. Ephesians 2:6, Colossians 3:1-3

#### d. Colossians 2:20d -- Why ...*do you submit yourself to decrees*? In the **fourth** place, asceticism relies on *decrees* DOGMATIZO or negative declarations. We do not practice asceticism because in reality it is basically a debasing form of **<u>slavery</u>**. Asceticism relies on depriving or afflicting yourself in order to be spiritual.

### 3. Colossians 2:21-23 -- Paul explained some very negative **<u>elements</u>** of asceticism.

#### a. Colossians 2:21 -- Sadly the error of asceticism is based on prohibitions and **<u>demands</u>** put on one's self. Paul therefore asks,"*Why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as...?*"

##### 1. Don't **<u>grab</u>** this!*Do not handle...*

##### 2. Don't **<u>put</u>** that in your mouth!*Do not taste*...

##### 3. And don't even think of laying a **<u>finger</u>** on it!*Do not touch*...

#### b. Colossians 2:22a --*Which all refer to things destined to perish with use...* Next Paul appropriately pointed out that asceticism quickly **<u>loses</u>** its effectiveness.

##### 1. If you try to better or control yourself by self-deprivation your efforts will unravel in time. You'll end up tossing out your efforts like an **<u>old</u>** ragged garment.

##### 2. In other words, this approach to spirituality will not **<u>last</u>** long and will **never** bring you the holiness you desire.

#### c. Colossians 2:22b -- Asceticism is ...*in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men.* Asceticism incorrectly follows earthly or human **<u>logic</u>**.

#### d. Colossians 2:23a --*These are matters, which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom*... Asceticism is **very** deceptive since on the outside it seems to be based on godly **<u>wisdom</u>**. James 3:13-18

##### 1. The deception of asceticism is that it gives an immediate fix to out-of-control living. Many Christians gravitate to any unbiblical answer if it seems to quickly solve their **<u>problem</u>**. Proverbs 14:12,16:25

##### 2. Our flesh opts for worldly solutions to provide temporary **<u>fixes</u>**. This keeps us from having to deal with the root problem, the sin nature.

#### e. Colossians 2:23b -- Asceticism is wrapped up ...*in self-made religion*... meaning contrived or homespun **<u>piety</u>**. The pious nature of asceticism makes it attractive to sincere believers. Galatians 3:2-3

#### f. Colossians 2:23c --*In*...*self-abasement*... Asceticism requires that the individual be abased or **<u>forced</u>** into subjection.*Self-abasement* TAPEINOPHROSUNE holds the idea of obligating yourself to experience a profound sense of insignificance. It is basically a form of beating up on yourself.

#### g. Colossians 2:23d -- Ultimately the heresy of asceticism requires ...***<u>severe</u>** treatment of the body*.

##### 1. Asceticism can go so far as to encourage cruel **<u>torture</u>** of the human body in order to gain spirituality.

##### 2. Supposing to gain points with God, there have been cases where people have **<u>starved</u>** themselves, beat themselves, or even submitted to crucifixion.

### 4. Colossians 2:23 -- Asceticism's folly: *But are of no value **<u>against</u>** fleshly indulgence*. In this one phrase Paul discarded asceticism as woefully inadequate for creating change. Why?

#### a. Initially in verse 20 we observed that asceticism is no more than the *elementary principles of the world* and therefore **<u>empty</u>** and deceptive. Colossians 2:8

#### b. Here we see that these futile efforts ...*are of no value against fleshly indulgence*. They do not harness **<u>evil</u>** desires or prevent selfish and immoral behavior.

##### 1. Asceticism does not deal with the **<u>root</u>** problem of the flesh, the cause of sin in our lives. Instead of encouraging a walk of faith focused on Christ, asceticism foolishly leads to the futility of trying to control the sin nature. Romans 7:8-11, Galatians 5:16-17

##### 2. This method always results in abject **<u>failure</u>**.

##### 3. Asceticism just cannot **<u>stop</u>** you from sinning or make you holy. The NET Bible puts it aptly, saying that instead of holy living *they in reality result in fleshly indulgence*. Asceticism's disaster is that it actually increases fleshly indulgence.

#### c. As with the other three heresies, asceticism is a major **<u>affront</u>** to Jesus Christ's adequacy to change believers.

##### 1. The heresy of asceticism **<u>demeans</u>** Christ's ability to make you holy.

##### 2. Asceticism rejects the important significance of our death with Christ to the sin nature, putting emphasis on self\'s **<u>ability</u>** to control the flesh rather than on our identification with the finished work of Christ on the cross. Romans 6:10-11

##### 3.**<u>Many</u>** of today's so-called spiritual disciplines are tantamount to asceticism.

#### d. Child of God, you have a choice. For holiness, you can go with asceticism and rely on your own efforts to change or you can learn to walk by **<u>faith</u>** relying on Christ\'s provisions for your sanctification. Colossians 2:6

# VII.**Colossians 3:1-11 -- Changed Focus: Keeping a Focus on Heaven**

## A.**Colossians 3:1-2 -- Paul encouraged the Colossians to develop a heavenly mindset based on their identity in Christ.**

### 1. Colossians 3:1a --*If then you have been **<u>raised</u>** up with Christ*... Our position in Christ is foundational to correct Christian living.

#### a.*If then you have been **<u>raised</u>** up with Christ...* The word *if* is a first class condition that could be understood as,"If you have been raised up with Christ,**and let's assume it is true**... therefore\..."

##### 1. This is a continuation of Paul's comment from Colossians 2:20. We saw the same conditional structure indicating that we did indeed **<u>die</u>** with Christ; therefore we are not to submit to the world system.

##### 2. Here, instead of reminding the Colossian believers of their death with Christ, Paul went a step further and reminded them of their resurrection together with Christ.*Raised up* denotes being both co-resurrected and co-ascended **<u>with</u>** Christ. Ephesians 2:6

##### 3. This identification **<u>with</u>** Christ was something done **to** the believer and not **by** the believer.

##### 4. Our co-resurrection with Christ is an accomplished **<u>fact</u>** in the mind of God. It occurred at the moment we put our faith in Christ.

#### b. Founded on the believer's spiritual position of being raised up with Christ, the apostle gave the Colossian believers **<u>two</u>** important commands about desires and focus (*keep seeking* and *set your mind*).

#### c.**Only** based out of our position of co-raised with Christ will we be able to properly **<u>obey</u>** these commands.

### 2. Colossians 3:1b --***Keep seeking** the things above...* Paul's first command to ***keep seeking*** is related to our **<u>desires</u>**.

#### a. The word *seek* ZETEO is a verb of intensity and passion that implies a diligent **<u>search</u>**. This verb was used to describe people determined to get to the bottom of a matter. Matthew 2:13,6:33; Acts 21:31; 1 Peter 5:8

#### b. Being a present active imperative shows that Paul was demanding an immediate and proactive search into *the things above*.

#### c. In order to advance our **<u>desire</u>** to seek heavenly things, Paul added two important realities about our resurrected Savior.

### 3. Colossians 3:1c -- We are commanded to seek the things that have to do with Christ's **finished work**.***Keep seeking** the things above **where Christ is [seated</u>***...

#### a. We have a risen and **<u>living</u>** Savior who is adequate for all our needs. Christ is seated in heaven because His work is finished. Hebrews 1:3,8:1-2

#### b. Not only do we have a qualified Savior, but also we have been **<u>fully</u>** identified with Him. We greatly benefit from this identification with Him. Romans 6:8-11

##### 1. If we died with Christ and we did, then we are indeed dead to **<u>sin</u>** just as He is. Sin's outright power and grip on our lives has been broken. Romans 6:2

##### 2. If we rose again with Christ and we did, then just as He is alive unto God we too are alive indeed unto **<u>God</u>**; therefore, we are no longer obligated to follow this satanic worldly system. Galatians 6:14

### 4. Colossians 3:1d -- We are further commanded to seek the things that have to do with Christ's **supreme authority**.***Keep seeking** the things above where Christ is seated **at the [right</u> hand of God***.

#### a. Seated at the right hand of God the Father, Jesus Christ has been given the most **<u>exalted</u>** position in the entire universe. Hebrews 4:16

#### b. He and no one else possesses this position of highest **<u>honor</u>** in heaven, and your sanctification is based on identification with Him there. Romans 6:11,2 Timothy 1:1

#### c. Since Christ is risen, seated and honored in this way, we can rest assured He is adequate for all our **<u>needs</u>**, wants, problems and questions. We ought therefore to *keep seeking* Him. No one else is worthy or able to help us.

### 5. Colossians 3:2a -- Paul's second command to ***set your [mind</u>** on things above* relates to our focus.

#### a. Set PHRONEO is another penetrating verb conveying the idea of pinpointing your focus or being very **<u>intent</u>** on something. In Philippians 2:5 it is translated *have this attitude* or *let this mind be in you*.

#### b. Paul appealed to our understanding of identification **<u>truths</u>** by commanding us to focus on heavenly things based on the fact that we have indeed been raised up with Christ as part of our position in Him. Proverbs 23:7a

#### c. The *things **<u>above</u>*** should become the focus of our thinking. How much of our thinking is actually absorbed with heavenly matters? Philippians 4:8

### 6. Colossians 3:2b --*Set your mind **on things above***... Paul wanted them to **<u>focus</u>** in on their heavenly position and possessions.

#### a. Did you know that your citizenship is in **<u>heaven</u>**? Philippians 3:20

#### b. Did you know you have a **<u>hope</u>** laid up for you in heaven? Colossians 1:5

#### c. Did you know you have a **<u>master</u>** in heaven who watches you? Colossians 4:1

#### d. Did you know you have an inheritance reserved for **<u>you</u>** in heaven? 1 Peter 1:4

#### e. Did you know you have been blessed with **<u>every</u>** spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms? Ephesians 1:3

#### f. Did you know you are guaranteed participation in the heavenly **<u>kingdom</u>**? Colossians 1:12,2 Timothy 4:18,1 Peter 1:3-5

#### g. Did you know you have been made the partaker of a heavenly **<u>calling</u>**? Hebrews 3:1

#### h. Did you know you are **<u>seated</u>** in Christ in heaven right now? Ephesians 2:6

### 7. Colossians 3:2c -- Don't *set your mind*...*on the things that are on **<u>earth</u>***.

#### a. Reject **<u>cheap</u>** earthly substitutes like the heresies Paul described in chapter two. All those deviations will detract you from spiritual progress.

##### 1. We should recognize the bankruptcy of philosophy, counting it as **<u>simple</u>**, elementary thinking and empty deception.

##### 2. Being merely a **<u>faint</u>** shadow of the truth, we ought to reject legalism.

##### 3. We should cast off mysticism as a distraction that removes us from our **<u>head</u>**, Jesus Christ.

##### 4. We should **<u>avoid</u>** all forms of asceticism as homespun religion, totally incapable of changing our fleshly passions and desires.

#### b. The story of Mary and Martha is a timeless example of setting our minds on heavenly things and **<u>not</u>** on the things of the earth. Luke 10:38-42, John 12:2-3

## B.**Colossians 3:3-4 -- Why should we have a heavenly mindset?**

### 1. Colossians 3:3a -- Why should we *seek* for and *set our minds* on heavenly things? Paul's first reason was,"*For you **<u>have</u>** died*."

#### a. Paul wanted the Colossians to align their thinking with God's thinking on this matter of having **<u>died</u>** with Christ.2 Corinthians 5:14; Galatians 5:24,6:14

#### b. Notice how Paul continually **<u>drew</u>** his readers back to positional, or identification, truth, particularly related to the death and resurrection of Christ. This was obviously of major importance to Paul, and therefore should be to us as well. Galatians 2:20

#### c. The mention of our death with Christ was intentional since this **<u>truth</u>** is the footing on which Paul built the doctrine of sanctification. Romans 6:1-11

#### d. Because you *have died*, or were *crucified with Christ*, your sin **<u>nature</u>** is without outright or absolute power over you. Romans 6:6; Colossians 2:11,3:1-4

### 2. Colossians 3:3b -- Paul gave a second reason why we are to *seek* for and *set our minds* on heavenly things. He stated,"*And your life is **<u>hidden</u>** with Christ in God*."

#### a. This is our present position in Christ and it provides us with amazing security. This is not only eternal security it is **<u>double</u>** eternal security.

#### b. In Greek Paul used the perfect tense in the phrase *is hidden*. This grammar brings out the point that God hid your life at a point in time in the **<u>past</u>** with results continuing all the way to the present.

#### c. In other words, your life has been hidden with Christ in God and it continues to be hidden all the way up to this very **<u>hour</u>**.

#### d. When God hides something, do you think **<u>anyone</u>** can find it? What about Satan? Can he get into God and find your life to steal you away? What about you? Can you find where God has hidden your life so as to break in and take it back?

### 3. Colossians 3:4a -- Paul gave a third reason why we are to *seek* for and *set our minds* on heavenly things. He stated that Christ is now our **<u>life</u>**.*When Christ,**who is our life** is revealed...*

#### a. John 15:1-5 -- Jesus is our source for **<u>living</u>**. Without Christ we can do nothing.

#### b. Philippians 1:21 -- Even though Paul considered death to be gain, every day he lived here below was for Christ and to **<u>Christ</u>**.*For to me to live is Christ*...

#### c. Galatians 2:20 -- Paul considered his life as a believer as belonging to Christ. He said that he no **<u>longer</u>** was the one living but Christ was living in him.

#### d. Colossians 1:27 -- Paul passionately revealed the mystery of *Christ in you, the hope of **<u>glory</u>***. He wanted believers to know what it means for Christ to live in and through the individual.

### 4. Colossians 3:4b -- Paul's statement gives us a fourth reason to *seek* for and *set our minds* on heavenly things. We do so because one day Christ will be **<u>openly</u>** manifested.*When Christ, who is our life **is revealed**...* At the second coming, Christ will be revealed in all His glory. Romans 2:16, Revelation 19:11-16

### 5. Colossians 3:4b -- Paul's fifth reason to *seek* for and *set our minds* on heavenly things is because one day when Christ is revealed we too will be revealed with Him in **<u>glory</u>**.*Then you also will be revealed **with Him in glory**...*

#### a. There are no conditions **<u>given</u>** here. Paul did not say,"If you are worthy, you will be revealed with Christ in glory." The truth is that not one of us is worthy. All believers are guaranteed glorification because *Christ is our Life.* There are no uncertainties in these words. Romans 8:18-19

#### b. Since we will most certainly be glorified with Christ, let's not live with a focus on the here and now. Don't live as the unsaved whose destiny is hell. Let's live like those who know with certainty that we **<u>will</u>** be with the Lord forever. Philippians 3:18-21

#### c. This world and its enticements are not what we live for. This is not all there is. We are strangers here. Our citizenship is in **<u>heaven</u>**. Since we will one day be with the Lord forever, let's keep focused on heavenly things. When Christ comes to get us we will return together with Him in blazing glory.1 Thess.4:17-18

## C.**Colossians 3:5-11 -- Therefore *seeking the things above* and having our *minds set on heavenly things*, how are we to now live?**

### 1. Colossians 3:5a --*Therefore*, in light of who you are in Christ.... We will now shift to see how positional truth affects our **<u>walk</u>** here below. Only to the degree you maintain a heavenly focus will you live victoriously here on earth; therefore, you must not disregard identification truth.

#### a. You **<u>died</u>** with Christ. Colossians 2:20

#### b. You were raised **up** together with Christ. Colossians 3:1

#### c. You have **<u>double</u>** eternal security....*hidden with Christ in God.* Colossians 3:3

#### d. Your life is summed up in the name "Christ."...*when Christ who is our **<u>life</u>***... Colossians 3:4a

#### e. You **<u>will</u>** be glorified, guaranteed.*Then you also will be revealed with him in glory*... Colossians 3:4b

### 2. Colossians 3:5b --*Consider ...as dead...* The command here is to literally ***<u>make</u>** dead*. The Greek word for "*consider...as dead*" NEKROO is an aorist, active, imperative verb.

#### a. The verb NEKROO means make as dead, deprive of **<u>power</u>** or put to death.

#### b. In using an aorist imperative versus the present imperative, Paul was commanding the believers to decisively do this action versus habitually doing it. In this case, it might be understood as get **<u>rid</u>** of it (kill it) as opposed to stop doing it (quit it).

#### c. Clearly Paul based his command on what he just said about being positionally **<u>dead</u>** with Christ.*Therefore,* based on that fact,*put to death,* or by faith apply death to the members of your bodies. Colossians 3:3

##### 1. Short of amputation, the only way you can make the members of your body dead is to do it by **<u>faith</u>**. Paul is not going back on his previous teaching and now teaching a form of asceticism.

##### 2. When you *consider the members of your earthly body as dead*, you apply in a practical way the positional truth of your death with Christ to sin, to your present condition -- to your daily walk here on this **<u>earth</u>**. Romans 6:2,11

##### 3. Putting to death the members of your earthly body involves cutting **<u>off</u>** the stream of influence between the sin nature and your physical body. You do this by faith in what God has already done. Romans 6:6-8a,2 Timothy 2:11

##### 4. You (the person inside your body) are dead to sin, so by faith **<u>count</u>** your body as being dead to sin as well. Like a dead person, you are not to offer the parts of your body to sin to become sin's slave again. You are to offer the parts of your body to God as instruments of righteousness. Romans 6:12-13

##### 5. To interpret this as anything other than a faith issue would mean Paul was saying to **<u>murder</u>** your body. That would be nothing short of the severe asceticism Paul spoke directly against in Colossians 2:20-23.

### 3. Colossians 3:5c -- Let\'s take a look at your body in relation to immoral sins. To what are we to consider the members of our earthly body as being dead? Paul spoke out against believers being involved in a number of disgraceful sins. By faith we are to make our **<u>body</u>** dead to the following sins.

#### a. Paul addressed some reprehensible **<u>sins</u>** that obviously a believer could, but should not ever, do. If it were impossible for believers to get caught up in these sins, as some people teach, Paul wasted his time in teaching against them.

##### 1.*Immorality* PORNEIA engulfs a **<u>large</u>** area of sexual deviations including premarital sex, adultery, homosexuality, incest, bestiality, prostitution and all forms of pornography.

##### 2.*Impurity* AKATHARSIA is a broad term referring to moral filthiness in thought, word or deed. The impure or unclean person focuses on the **<u>dirty</u>** side of everything.

##### 3.*Passion* PATHOS describes sin's depraved cravings or repulsive **<u>drives</u>**.

##### 4.*Evil desires* is a phrase that designates totally impure cravings or a hunger for that which is **<u>vile</u>**.

##### 5.*Greed* PLEONEXIA is a compound word in Greek that means have-**<u>more</u>**.

##### 6.*Greed, which is idolatry*... God equates **<u>greed</u>** with idolatry.

###### a. In reality *idolatry* is the worship of an **<u>object</u>** for personal advantage.

###### b. In *idolatry* you give service (burn a candle, make a promise, give something, etc.) to an object of worship (image, statue or **<u>icon</u>**) if you can get something in return (advantage, promotion, health or wealth) from that object.

###### c. According to **<u>God</u>** the pursuit of idolatry is nothing more than pure greed.

#### b. Let\'s consider some **<u>thoughts</u>** on these sins of the body.

##### 1. Each of these moral **<u>ills</u>** represents an intense emotional pull, with extreme passion, lack of restraint, physical or mental abandonment, or complete immersion.

##### 2. Since your body is a neutral entity, it ultimately becomes a slave of the one to whom you **<u>present</u>** it. The body can become a slave of sin or a slave to the Lord. Romans 6:12-23

##### 3. The human body is not the cause of **<u>sin</u>**.

###### a. Even though your body is under the **<u>curse</u>** of Genesis 3, and is groaning as it waits for the day of redemption (Rom.8:23), it is still the temple of God's Holy Spirit.1 Corinthians 6:19-20

###### b. Since God made your body His **<u>temple</u>**, logically your body is not intrinsically evil (Gnosticism).

###### c. Simply put, your **<u>body</u>** is like a vessel that is either being filled by God the Holy Spirit or by the fleshly nature. Galatians 5:16-17

##### 4. Romans 8:12-13 -- Therefore, by means of faith in God's Holy Spirit, you should put to death the deeds of the body. If you do so, you will **<u>live</u>**.

### 4. Colossians 3:6-7 -- Why not present our bodies to sin? Paul gave **<u>two</u>** very practical reasons why we should put the members of our bodies to death in relation to sin.

#### a. Colossians 3:6 -- Paul\'s **<u>first</u>** reason for why we should avoid the sins that he just mentioned is because of impending judgment on those who are characterized by such sins.

##### 1. Colossians 3:6a --***Because of these things** the wrath of God is coming...* The unsaved, the ones who give themselves over to these kinds of sins, will **<u>not</u>** escape the coming wrath of God. Romans 1:18,1 Corinthians 6:9-11, Galatians 5:21

##### 2. Colossians 3:6b --*Because of these things the wrath of God is coming **on the sons of disobedience***. The phrase *on the **<u>sons</u>** of disobedience* is key to understanding Paul's warning. The *sons of disobedience* refers to the unsaved world and not to saints. Ephesians 2:1-3

###### a. Thankfully Scriptures testify that God's children are guaranteed to **<u>escape</u>***the coming wrath* of God. John 3:36; Romans 5:9; 1 Thessalonians 1:10,5:9

###### b. Paul was saying that as saints we should **<u>never</u>** be found involved in the sins that the *sons of disobedience*, the unsaved of the world who will be judged under the wrath of God, do as a way of life. Romans 6:20-23, Ephesians 5:6

#### b. Colossians 3:7 -- Paul gave a **<u>second</u>** reason for not getting involved in the sins listed in verse five. We should avoid these sins because they describe things that we did, but they do not describe who we are now.

##### 1. Colossians 3:7a --*And**in them*(among those who commit such evil sins)*you also once **<u>walked</u>***... We understand that these evils were part of our old manner of life.

##### 2. Colossians 3:7b --*When you were **<u>living</u>** in them...* There was once a time when we lived as part of those who commit such sins. Those kinds of sins are part of our old way of life and not who we are today. Romans 6:20-23

###### a. Paul did not imply by this statement that believers couldn't commit these types of **<u>sins</u>**.

###### b. If it were impossible for believers to do the sins listed in verse 5, Paul would not have taught the Colossians to put such things to **<u>death</u>**.

###### c. In the very next verse Paul went on to insist that we **<u>put</u>** such things away from our lives.*But now you also, put them all aside*... Colossians 2:8a

### 5. Colossians 3:8-9a -- Paul moved on to another list of sins we should **<u>remove</u>** from our lives. We can call these evils temperament sins.

#### a. Colossians 3:8a --*But now you also, put them all aside*... Although these sins all belonged to our former manner of life, we tend to allow them as "acceptable sins" in our lives and churches. Paul said to put them off and lay them **<u>aside</u>**, together with all the sins listed in verse five.

#### b. Colossians 3:8b --***<u>Wrath</u>***, ORGE in Greek, describes the smoldering, long-term emotion that eventually boils forth in viciousness.

#### c. Colossians 3:8c --***<u>Anger</u>*** THUMOS is an impulsive emotion. It is a red-hot ember ready to burst into flames at the slightest provocation. Provocation does not produce this anger, but beware, it will reveal it.

#### d. Colossians 3:8d --***<u>Malice</u>*** KAKIA is a spiteful attitude that has as its goal vengeance and harm to others.

#### e. Colossians 3:8e --***<u>Slander</u>*** BLASPHEMIA is making false charges that misrepresent and defame others. It is to verbally destroy someone.

#### f. Colossians 3:8f --***<u>Abusive</u> speech*** AISCHROLOGIA includes everything from words spoken in poor taste to obscenity and dirty language. Ephesians 5:4

#### g. Colossians 3:9a --***Do not [lie</u>*** ME PSEUDOMAI is the final statement in this list of sins and is self-explanatory.

#### h. How can we effectively lay **<u>aside</u>** all these sins?

##### 1. First of all, it is **<u>not</u>** through human reasoning, self-imposed religion, mystical experiences, or the spiritual disciplines that we will lay them aside. These methods were all condemned as ineffective in the previous chapter.

##### 2. The true solution to **<u>all</u>** sin is to actively depend in faith on our death with Christ to sin and our resurrection with Him to newness of life and then on that basis to present our bodies to God for His use. Romans 6:1-13

### 6. Colossians 3:9b-11 -- Paul gave some positive reasons not to indulge in the **<u>sins</u>** of the flesh.

#### a. Colossians 3:9b --*Since you **<u>laid</u>** aside the old self*... We already *laid aside* the *old self* at the day of our salvation. Romans 6:6a

##### 1. The **<u>old</u>** self (also called the old man) is your old identity; it is who you were in Adam.

##### 2. When you were born, you were born into the wrong family. You were born in **<u>Adam</u>**; therefore, before salvation you were identified with fallen Adam.

##### 3. In your original hopeless relationship with Adam, God rejected you. Ephesians 1:1-3

##### 4. Then at the moment you were born again, you *laid aside* the old self. Your old rejected self was crucified with Christ and ceased to **<u>exist</u>**. Romans 6:6a

###### a. Here *laid aside* APEKDUOMAI means to completely **<u>undress</u>**. APO means away from and EKDYO means stripped off. It is likely that Paul coined this word since it is not found in Greek writings previous to the time of Paul.

###### b. The word *laid aside* APEKDUOMAI in this verse is different from the word ***<u>put</u>** off* APOTITHEMI used in verse 8.

###### c. In verse 8 we were told to *put off* specific sins but the word *laid aside* here is not saying to put off the *old self*. Quite the contrary. It is stating this as an already accomplished **<u>fact</u>**.

###### d. The verb *laid aside* is an aorist, middle voice participle implying something that was already **<u>done</u>** at a point in time in the past and was done to you not by you.

###### e. The **<u>force</u>** of the word *laid aside* describes the fact that at salvation God ripped off of you your old identity in Adam (the *old self or old man*) and therefore that person no longer exists. Your *old self* was crucified with Christ. Romans 6:6

##### 5. God stripped you of your *old self* so that your sin nature (also called the *flesh* or *indwelling sin*) might be rendered powerless **<u>over</u>** you. Romans 6:6b,7:17-20

#### b. Colossians 3:9c -- Since you have *laid aside the old self with its evil practices*(your old identity in Adam no longer exists)*,* you should never go back and indulge the **<u>flesh</u>** with either its sins of immorality or sins of temperament. Colossians 3:5,3:8-9a

##### 1. Again, why should you and I as believers not sin? To answer this, Paul predictably returned to a positional (identification) argument: "Because when we **<u>died</u>** with Christ, we were stripped of our old identity in Adam." Romans 6:1-11

##### 2. Colossians 3:5 --*Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as **<u>dead</u>***...

##### 3. Romans 6:2b --*How shall we who died to sin still live in it*?

#### c. Colossians 3:10a --*And have put on the new self*... You have already been clothed with the ***<u>new</u>** self.*

##### 1. Your *new self* is the new person you are **<u>now</u>** in Christ. As far as God is concerned, the old you is dead and gone. You have a new identity. You have *put on* ENDUO *the new self*. Romans 5:12-18

###### a.*Put on* ENDUO means to **<u>dress</u>** in. It is a compound word in Greek that literally means to sink into.

###### b. Here the word is an aorist, middle voice participle that shows that this action already happened to you at a point in time in the past and it was done to you not by you. At the point of salvation,**<u>God</u>** dressed you in your *new self*.

##### 2. Your new self came into being the **<u>moment</u>** you believed in Christ and were born again.1 Peter 1:3,23

##### 3. At the moment of salvation, you were born again into the family of God. Through death you left Adam's lineage and by **<u>rebirth</u>** you were joined to Christ's lineage. John 3:3-8

##### 4. You are now a new creation and eternally related to Jesus Christ by **<u>birth</u>**(rebirth).2 Corinthians 5:14-18,1 Peter 1:3,23

##### 5. Since you have *put on the new self*, don't indulge in the sins of the **<u>flesh</u>**.

#### d. Colossians 3:10b --*Put on the new self **who is being renewed to a true knowledge***... Your *new self*, or the new you, is designed by **<u>God</u>** to be refreshed and renewed on an ongoing basis. Romans 7:22,2 Corinthians 4:16, Ephesians 4:22-24

##### 1.*...who is being renewed*... This renewal is something **<u>God</u>** Himself does to us, and it is something He desires to do on a continual and ongoing basis.

##### 2.*...to a true knowledge...* This literally reads "which is being renewed ***in****<u>true</u>** knowledge*." In other words, as you personally fellowship with Christ, you will daily be renewed in your beliefs.2 Corinthians 3:18; 2 Peter 1:3,3:18

#### e. Colossians 10c --*...according to the image of the One who created him*. God planned for you to live the Christian life by needing consistent, ongoing, personal and intimate fellowship with **<u>Jesus</u>** Christ.

##### 1. God designed the *new self* to constantly **<u>be</u>** refreshed and renewed into Christ's likeness. As this happens, you grow.2 Corinthians 3:18

##### 2. If you continually live according to the flesh, committing the sins listed above, you are **<u>not</u>** going to grow in the true knowledge of Christ and you will not daily be refreshed or renewed. Ephesians 4:17-24

##### 3. You need a consistent walk of fellowship with Jesus Christ because it is only then that you are refreshed, encouraged and edified in this life. Of course, this growth **<u>starts</u>** with understanding your identification in Christ with His death and resurrection. Colossians 2:20; 3:1-4

#### f. Colossians 3:11a --*A **<u>renewal</u>** in which there is no distinction*... Lest we become self-righteous, Paul gave a list of diversities to show that there really are no differences among those who are ***in Christ***.

##### 1.*There is no distinction between Greek and Jew...*

###### a. The Greeks were the **<u>social</u>** elite class in New Testament times. Paul said that what mattered was the *new self* not pop-culture.

###### b. The Jews were the **<u>religious</u>** elite of the day. Jewish people felt they were the only people in the world who could know God. Paul said that what mattered was the *new self* not some religious affiliation.

##### 2.*There is no distinction between... circumcised and uncircumcised*... Galatians 6:15

###### a. The circumcised referred to those who thought they had God\'s approval because of the **<u>ritual</u>** of circumcision.

###### b. Uncircumcised was a term of disparity given by circumcised Jews to the **<u>rest</u>** of humanity. It designated them as less than pure or holy and distanced from God.

##### 3.*There is no distinction between... Barbarian, Scythian*...

###### a. Barbarian was a term for anyone who did not **<u>speak</u>** the Greek language. With time barbarian acquired the connotation of brutish or rude. What mattered was the *new self* not education or language.

###### b. Scythians were a **<u>group</u>** described by the Greek historian Herodotus (BC 500) as a people who lived in wagons, offered human sacrifices, scalped, and even sometimes carved up, the bodies of their slain enemies.

###### c. Herodotus said that the Scythians drank the **<u>blood</u>** of their enemies and used their skulls for drinking-cups.

###### d. Paul would say that what mattered was the *new self*, not being a cut above the **<u>savages</u>** of this world.

##### 4.*There is no distinction between...**slave** and freeman*...

###### a. Slaves were the **<u>lowest</u>** class of humans in Greek society. Having this lot in life held great scorn. Paul stated that what mattered was the *new man* and not status or lack thereof.

###### b. In Greek society, freemen were considered to be real people, and they alone enjoyed rights. Paul would say that neither **<u>liberty</u>** nor the lack of liberty is what matters because in Christ we are all free. Galatians 5:1

##### 5. Paul\'s concluded that for the Christian **<u>none</u>** of these things held any significance on the one hand or impediment on the other.

###### a. God sees only **<u>two</u>** kinds of people in this world: those who are *in Christ* and those who are still *in Adam*.

###### b. Within the body of Christ, we are all on **<u>level</u>** ground. Galatians 3:26-28

#### g. Colossians 3:11b --*But Christ is all, and in all*. Christ, as sovereign God, is adequate for **<u>all</u>** our needs.

##### 1.*Christ **is all**...* Christ is everything to us, and He is all that really matters. Because of Christ, God defines us as His children. My level of education, my race, my social status or economic state is not what defines me. Christ defines *who* I am. Christ alone **<u>gives</u>** me significance.

##### 2.*Christ is all **and in all**...* Christ lives in our **<u>lives</u>**. He lives IN every believer without exception, no matter what our particular condition or status. Christ being in us gives us true significance. Ephesians 4:4-5, Colossians 3:3

# IV. Colossians 3:12-17 -- Changed Person: Living a New Life as a New Person

## A. Colossians 3:12 -- Paul made [three</u> amazing statements about the new you.

### 1.*So, as those who have been **chosen** of God*... As a believer in Christ you are a **<u>chosen</u>** EKLEKTOS (called out one) of God. By means of the Gospel, God called you forth from the vile world system in which you were mired down and ensnared. Colossians 1:21

######## a. This word EKLEKTOS is **<u>never</u>** used of unbelievers. It is a doctrine that belongs exclusively to those who are saved.

#### b. This is a position of extreme **<u>honor</u>** and reflects the special place we have in God's sight because of our union with Christ, God's Elect One. Ephesians 1:4,1 Peter 1:20

### 2.*So, as those who have been chosen of God,**holy***... You are one of God's **<u>holy</u>** ones. God already considers you to be set apart from the profane and godless world system.1 Corinthians 1:30,1 Peter 2:9

### 3.*So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and **beloved***... Whether or not you accept it as a fact, you are a dearly **<u>loved</u>** one of God. Romans 8:31-39,1 John 3:1-2

#### a.*Beloved* is a perfect tense participle emphasizing that not only were you loved in the **<u>past</u>**, you continue on in that state in the present. God's love for you is unconditional and unending.

#### b. Being chosen, holy and beloved, how should we live?

## B.**Colossians 3:12b-14 -- In what should you dress the new you?**

### 1. Colossians 3:12b --***Put on** a **<u>heart</u>** of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience*...*Put on* ENDUO is a middle voice aorist imperative that literally means sink into. Figuratively we might say,"Let yourself be clothed in these."

#### a.*A heart of **<u>mercy</u>*** conveys compassion, tenderhearted love, pity and tender mercy toward others.

#### b.*Kindness* refers to **<u>kind</u>** feelings, honest goodness and nonthreatening goodwill toward everyone in your world.

#### c.*Humility* speaks of a **<u>deep</u>** sense of your own personal smallness, being truly modest as opposed to being arrogant.

#### d.*Gentleness* conveys a mild-mannered disposition and **<u>quiet</u>** strength.

#### e.*Patience* speaks of discipline, the **<u>power</u>** to undergo any suffering, a reluctance to avenge wrongs and endurance.

#### f. It is God who provides these graces as a true **<u>garment</u>**, and our part is to allow them to become ours.

##### 1. Before listing off these **<u>graces</u>**, Paul clarified how to and how not to be godly.

##### 2. These graces do **<u>not</u>** come through philosophy, legalism, mysticism or asceticism.

##### 3. As you walk by **<u>faith</u>** in Christ, the Spirit of God will readily produce these in your life. Galatians 5:22-23

##### 4. It is your **<u>job</u>** to actively present yourself to God by faith and to not present yourself to the old nature. Romans 6:12-14

### 2. Colossians 3:13a --***<u>Bearing</u>** with one another*... As God's chosen, holy and loved ones, we are also told to **put up with** one another.

### 3. Colossians 3:13b --*And forgiving one another just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.* As God's chosen, holy and loved ones, we are to **put on**,**put up with** and **put [right</u>** all relationships. Matthew 18:21-22

#### a.*And forgiving one another...* Unforgiveness is such a **<u>killer</u>**. Unforgiveness leads to bitterness and bitterness leads to more unforgiveness. It's a cancer that will eat you alive. Hebrews 12:15

#### b.*Just as the Lord forgave you,**so also should you**.* We are told to forgive in the **<u>same</u>** way that Christ has forgiven us. Luke 5:20-24; Romans 5:8,17-19

##### 1. In the cross Jesus Christ personally forgave us **<u>more</u>** sins that we committed against Him than could possibly be committed against us by anyone else. Romans 4:7-8,1 John 2:12

##### 2. Jesus Christ eternally forgave all **<u>sins</u>** before any one of us could possibly ask, and that forgiveness was applied to our account the moment we believed. Romans 5:8; Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:14,2:13

##### 3. In light of **<u>Christ's</u>** unconditional forgiveness of all our sins, we should willingly forgive anyone against whom we have a complaint.2 Corinthians 5:19, Luke 23:34

### 4. Colossians 3:14 -- Finally and *beyond all these things put on **<u>love</u>**, which is the perfect bond of unity*. As God's chosen, holy and loved ones, we are to put on, over and above all else, the mantle of love. Galatians 5:22a

#### a. Above all else, you should be wearing love as an overcoat.*But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the **greatest** of these is **<u>love</u>**.*1 Corinthians 13:13

#### b. Love is the superglue, the *perfect **<u>bond</u>** of unity*, that holds us all together as believers. Unity is love in action.

## C.**Colossians 3:15-17 -- *Let* some important things happen to the new you**

### 1. Colossians 3:15 -- The first "let" command: ***Let** the peace of Christ **<u>rule</u>** in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful.*

#### a. Colossians 3:15a -- The command is to **<u>let</u>** peace rule. Don't stop or disallow peace from ruling in your hearts.

##### 1. When you have a "**<u>let</u>**" command in Scripture, it is typically translating a passive voice imperative verb in Greek.

##### 2. The imperative tense means you have a command to **<u>obey</u>**. The passive voice indicates that you are to allow or permit it to happen, not to make it happen.

##### 3. The difference might be understood in a mother who says to a squirming child,"Let me **<u>dress</u>** you," versus the command,"Get dressed."

##### 4. Paul was saying that Christ's peace wants to govern in your life and you are to permit it to happen. This is not a directive to **<u>create</u>** peace; it is a directive to not stop the peace of Christ from governing in your life.

#### b. Colossians 3:15b -- Paul said for the Colossian believers to **<u>allow</u>** the peace that Christ gives to be a mediator BRABEUO (*rule*) in their hearts.

##### 1. We all know from personal experience that peace is not natural to the human experience. We all struggle with **<u>fears</u>**, anxiety and worries. Our hearts are prone to turmoil. Romans 3:17

###### a. The prophet Jeremiah exclaimed,"The human heart is *...more **<u>deceitful</u>** than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it*?" Jeremiah 17:9

###### b. Psalm 139:23 --*Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me and know my **<u>anxious</u>** thoughts; and see if there be any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."\*

##### 2. God has made Christ's **<u>peace</u>** available to us. Jesus told His disciples,"*Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful*." John 14:27

###### a. God gives peace to those who entrust their **<u>cares</u>** to Him. Philippians 4:6-7,1 Peter 5:7

###### b. Isaiah 26:3 --*The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, because he trusts in **<u>You</u>***.

###### c. Jesus promised to give rest to all the **<u>weary</u>** who trust in Him. Matthew 11:28-30

##### 3. For these reasons, under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, Paul prevailed on the believers in Colossae to allow Christ's **<u>peace</u>** to arbitrate in their hearts.

#### c. Colossians 3:15b --*Let the peace of Christ rule...to which indeed you were called in **<u>one</u>** body*.

##### 1. If we were each an **<u>island</u>** to ourselves it might not matter if we enjoyed peace in our hearts. Turmoil would be considered a private sin that doesn't hurt anyone but us personally. This Scripture indicates just the opposite. It does matter corporately if individually we have peace or not.

##### 2. As members of the body of Christ, we are to build each other up. We are to not destroy each other nor cause others to **<u>doubt</u>** the Lord. Ephesians 4:16

##### 3. Your **<u>sins</u>** affect the body of Christ. If you are worried, fretting and not trusting the Lord, it affects others around you. Psalm 37:8

##### 4. Anytime you walk according to the flesh, it negatively impacts the **<u>body</u>** of Christ. Galatians 6:7-8

##### 5. A lack of peace communicates a lack of **<u>trust</u>** in the goodness and sovereignty of God, and just like gossip or bitterness, it becomes a virus that invades the whole church.1 John 4:18

#### d. Colossians 3:15d --*Let the peace of Christ rule ...and be **<u>thankful</u>***. Psalm 100:4

##### 1. To compliment the command to let the **<u>peace</u>** of Christ rule, Paul further commanded the Colossians to be thankful. To be continually thankful is a present tense command.

##### 2. Thankfulness naturally springs forth as a response to the internal peace that Christ **<u>gives</u>**.

##### 3. When we **<u>fail</u>** to count our blessings through thanksgiving, bitterness naturally prevails in our thinking.

###### a. To counteract despair, Paul encouraged the Thessalonians saying,"*In everything **<u>give</u>** thanks for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus*."1 Thessalonians 5:18

###### b. Giving thanks *in everything* includes verbal appreciation for the good, the bad and the **<u>ugly</u>**. Romans 5:3

### 2. Colossians 3:16-17 -- Paul's second "let" command: *Let the **<u>Word</u>** of Christ richly dwell within you*...

#### a. Colossians 3:16a --*Let the Word of Christ richly **<u>dwell</u>** within you* is an opulent statement.

##### 1. The word ***<u>dwell</u>*** ENOIKEO is a compound word made up of EN meaning in and OIKEO to dwell. It means to inhabit as in a residence. Figuratively it communicated the idea of influencing by proximity.

##### 2. The question could be asked,"What will ultimately influence your heart and mind?" Paul commanded the Colossian believers to **<u>allow</u>** Christ\'s Word to influence their hearts.

###### a. Let the Word of Christ dwell richly in you means God wants you to allow Christ's words to **<u>invade</u>** your life in such a meaningful way that they end up changing you.2 Corinthians 3:18

###### b. God is not satisfied with Christ's words simply being in your mind in an academic way; He wants them to have a profound **<u>impact</u>** on your life. James 1:22-24

###### c.*Let the Word of Christ richly **<u>dwell</u>** within you...* can essentially be understood as a synonym for *be filled with the Spirit* as seen in a comparison of Ephesians 5:18-21 with Colossians 3:16-17.

##### 3. In Ephesians 3:15-17, Paul made this issue a matter of prayer. He prayed that Christ Himself might influence them by being completely at **<u>home</u>** in their lives.

#### b. Colossians 3:16c-17 -- When the Word of Christ **<u>richly</u>** dwells within you, it is in essence Christ at ease, residing in your life. Ephesians 3:17,5:18-21

##### 1. Colossians 3:16c --*With all wisdom **<u>teaching</u>** one another...* First of all, having the Word of Christ at home in your heart will revolutionize your way of teaching.**Your message will be changed**. Proverbs 10:31-32,31:26

###### a. To **<u>teach</u>** is to pass on truth in an ordered manner so that God's people can be edified.2 Timothy 4:2

###### b. Teaching is typically a positive method of communicating the **<u>truth</u>** to others. Having the Word of God abound in your life gives you a constructive message. Proverbs 2:6,1 Timothy 4:13

##### 2. Colossians 3:16b --...*with all wisdom...**admonishing** one another*. Secondly, with the Word of Christ presiding over your life,**your way of correcting others will [change</u>****dramatically**.

###### a. When the words of Christ dwell in you richly, you are then ready to **<u>warn</u>**, rebuke and correct others in all wisdom as necessary. Proverbs 2:6

###### b. Fellow believers do not always eagerly receive admonishment but by letting the words of Christ abound in your heart,**<u>God</u>** will empower you in this corrective ministry.

##### 3. Colossians 3:16e -- Thirdly, having the Word of Christ dominant in your life **will change your tune**. Your **<u>singing</u>** to God will be affected.

###### a. You'll be singing with **<u>psalms</u>**. Written to be sung with a stringed instrument like the harp, psalms PSALMOS were Israel's songs of worship. The book of Psalms was a collection of the most common songs of Israel. Psalm 42 "As the Deer" is an example of a psalm we sing today.

###### b. You'll be singing with **<u>hymns</u>**. Before Christianity, hymns HUMNOS were anthems, sacred songs or ballads sung to commemorate heroes, gods or conquerors. Songs like "How Great Thou Art" fall into this genre. Some have dubbed these types of songs high praise.

###### c. You'll be singing with **spiritual [songs</u>** or spiritual odes. ODE is the Greek word for song (Rev.5:9). Greek odes were poems that were sung. Typically odes expressed deep feelings. Praise and worship music would most aptly fit this category.

###### d. You'll be *singing ...**<u>with</u>** thankfulness*. The starting point of true worship is gratitude.

###### e. You'll be *singing ...in your **<u>hearts</u>*** and not just with your lips. True worship flows out of the heart. Letting the Word of Christ reside in your heart will produce genuine worship.

###### f. You'll be *singing ...to God*. With the Word of Christ prevailing in your heart you will not be singing for the guy in the next pew. You'll be singing for God's sake, God's **<u>ears</u>** and God's glory alone.

##### 4. Colossians 3:17a -- Fourthly, with the Word of Christ ruling in your heart **your work ethic will be altered**. You'll learn to labor for **<u>God's</u>** glory and not man's hollow praise.

###### a. When he said,"*Whatever you do in word or deed*," Paul was emphasizing how the Word of Christ in our hearts will influence **<u>all</u>** our **actions**. This shows that compartmentalization or Sunday Christianity is pure hypocrisy.

###### b. When Paul said ***<u>do</u>** all in the name of the Lord Jesus*... he showed the true motivation we are to have all day, every day. This emphasizes how our **attitudes** can be transformed as the Word of Christ saturates our thinking.

###### i. In an effort to protect their **<u>image</u>** many Christians are not honest and transparent. They go through the motions of spirituality to look good on the outside, but their motivations are wrong.

###### ii. When we simply go through the motions of the Christian life instead of *doing all in the name of the Lord Jesus* in order to **<u>please</u>** God, we deceive others, but even more disastrously we cheat ourselves of the real purpose of life, bringing glory to God.2 Peter 1:8-11

##### 5. Colossians 3:17b -- Fifthly, as the Word of Christ permeates our thinking **our appreciation for the [Lord</u> will change**.*Giving thanks through Him to God the Father*. We'll develop an attitude of gratitude.

# V. Colossians 3:18-4:1 -- Changed Relationships Through the Word of Christ

## A. Colossians 3:18 -- Teaching for the believing wife (Eph.5:22-24,33;****1 Pet.3:1-6)

### 1. General comment

#### a. What Paul taught is in stark contrast to paganism in which the husband was typically lord of the household and considered above the mundane tasks of running a **<u>home</u>**. The daily duties and responsibilities of the home rested on wives and slaves.

#### b. Conversely, in Christianity, although the husband is the **<u>head</u>** of the home, the daily responsibilities for the household depend on both the husband and wife.

### 2. Colossians 3:18 -- Teaching for the Christian wife

#### a. Colossians 3:18a --***Wives**, be subject to your husbands*... The biblical standard is for wives to voluntarily subject themselves to their **<u>own</u>** husbands.

##### 1. In Paul's teachings on the Christian family in Colossians, it is noteworthy that he gave only **<u>one</u>** verse of instruction directly to wives.

##### 2. Paul presented the role of the Christian **<u>wife</u>** in a straightforward, uncomplicated manner. We do well to follow his example.

#### b. Colossians 3:18b --*Wives **be subject***...*Be subject* HUPOTASSO a compound word that was standard **<u>military</u>** jargon. There is no weakness conveyed in this expression at all.

##### 1. This word HUPOTASSO means to willingly put yourself in full battle array as though prepared for **<u>war</u>**. The Christian wife is to array herself battle-ready, under the authority of her husband.

###### a. There is no greater form of **<u>faith</u>** than when a wife willingly entrusts herself to God by entrusting herself to the leadership of a fallen man like her own husband.

###### b. Submission is truly an act of faith or **<u>trust</u>**. Is the wife willing to trust the Lord and take her stand under the authority of her husband? That is biblical submission.

##### 2. Biblical submission does **<u>not</u>** mean mindlessness. The word submission implies that there will be differing opinions. In moments of disagreement when a decision must be made, God calls for the wife to willingly trust her husband's decision.

##### 3. There is **<u>nothing</u>** demeaning about biblical submission. The Christian wife is to submit to her husband in the same way Christ submits to His Father. We would never consider Jesus demeaned by His willing subjection to the Father.1 Corinthians 3:23,11:3; Matthew 26:39,42

#### c. Colossians 3:18c --*Wives, be subject **to your husbands***... This verse is not teaching that women should submit to **<u>men</u>** in general.

##### 1. This does not speak of an inferior position, status or significance. Wives are fellow heirs with their husbands of the grace of God.(1 Pet.3:7) Women have equal status and **<u>value</u>** in the body of Christ with men. Galatians 3:28

##### 2. This is also **<u>not</u>** teaching that women cannot hold public offices or be the president of a corporation. There is nothing like that implied in this verse.

##### 3. This is teaching that the believing wife of her own **<u>will</u>** is to choose to subject herself to **her** own husband.

#### d. Colossians 3:18a -- An important understanding of a believing wife's duty is incrusted in the statement *as is fitting **<u>in</u>** the Lord*.

##### 1.*As is fitting* ANEKO means appropriate or **<u>suitable</u>**.

##### 2.*In the* Lord speaks of the daughter of God, who because she **<u>belongs</u>** to the Lord, submits to her own husband. Indeed, in like manner, Christ, her supreme example, willingly subjected Himself to the Father.

###### a. When a believing wife **<u>willingly</u>** and actively submits to her own husband, it is greatly honoring to Christ.

###### b. In Titus 2:5, speaking of the wife of the deacon, Paul further illustrated this: *Being subject to their **<u>own</u>** husbands,**so that the word of God will not be dishonored***.

###### c. The believing wife who understands God's **<u>order</u>**, plan and purpose for her in marriage knows that her ultimate happiness is found only in willingly fulfilling God's design.

### 3. Ephesians 5:22-24,33 -- To complement our study concerning the believing **<u>wife</u>** we will now add Paul's parallel teaching for wives from the book of Ephesians.

#### a. Ephesians 5:22 -- Here again we see the biblical rule: *Wives be subject to your **<u>own</u>** husbands.*

##### 1. Here the command is essentially the same as in Colossians 3:18, with the addition of the **<u>concept</u>***to your **own** husbands*.

##### 2. This is not a command for wives to submit to men in general, but rather specifically and very exclusively to their ***<u>own</u>** husbands*.

#### b. Ephesians 5:33 -- Paul further expanded on the command of submission to include **<u>respect</u>** saying,"*And the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.*"

##### 1. Proverbs 12:4 says,"*An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who shames \[him\] is like rottenness in his bones.*" A woman who disrespects her husband **<u>shames</u>** him. This should never be true of the believing wife.

##### 2. Proverbs 31:12 and 23 state,"*She does him good and not evil all the days of her life ...her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.*" When a believing wife respects her husband, he will be confident and hold his head **<u>high</u>** in everyday circumstances.

##### 3. Instead of being **<u>fearful</u>** and seeking to control her world, a believing wife would be wise to transfer her well-being to her husband and entrust herself to his care. This part of respecting her husband will bring peace to her own heart.

#### c. In Ephesians 5:23a Paul went on to give an overarching principle for submission: *For the husband is the **<u>head</u>***(God-ordained authority)*of the wife*.

##### 1. To be the **<u>head</u>** implies not only leadership but also accountability and responsibility, two things that most men are not naturally inclined to do well.

##### 2. For Eve back in the Garden of Eden, Adam was a colossal failure in leadership. If you are under a less than perfect, or even unspiritual, man, this will be an ongoing challenge to your walk of **<u>faith</u>** as a woman of God. God will give you grace as you trust in Him. Luke 1:45

#### d. In Ephesians 5:23 Paul added that the believing wife should subject herself to her own husband because God ordained the Christian marriage to be a **<u>model</u>** of Christ and His bride. The church's subjection to Christ parallels the role of the Christian wife toward her husband.

#### e. Ephesians 5:24 --*But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything*. The believing wife should be subject to her own husband in every way just as the **<u>church</u>** is called to be subject to her head, Jesus Christ, in all things.

### 4.1 Peter 3:1-6 -- Peter also taught on the **<u>role</u>** of the Christian wife. Let's consider his teaching.

#### a.1 Peter 3:1a --*In the **<u>same</u>** way, you wives, be submissive...* The phrase *in the same way* refers back to Christ's example of resolute perseverance in the midst of the difficulties of life and death.1 Peter 2:21-25

#### b.1 Peter 3:1a -- The instruction is: ...*wives, be submissive to your own husbands*.

##### 1. Peter and Paul had the **<u>same</u>** basic command for wives: Be submissive.

##### 2. We will observe that Peter used a different rationale for **<u>why</u>** the believing wife should be submissive.

#### c.1 Peter 3:1b-2 -- Let's consider **<u>Peter's</u>** reason for willing submission.

##### 1.1 Peter 3:1b-2 --*So that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word...* Peter encouraged submission from believing wives because he concluded that even a disobedient-to-the-Word husband could be ***<u>won</u>*** over for God without the wife even opening her mouth.

##### 2.1 Peter 3:2 --*...by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.* The quiet manner of a wife speaks **<u>volumes</u>**. Sadly some believing women speak through every way except through a quiet spirit.

#### d.1 Peter 3:3-4a -- Speaking to wives Peter added,"*Your adornment must not be merely external...but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a **<u>gentle</u>** and quiet spirit.*"

##### 1. Although Jesus was gentle, meek and lowly, He was in no way a pushover or **<u>weak</u>**. Jesus was very sure of Himself and confident, yet He resigned Himself completely to do His Father's will.

##### 2. Proverbs 31:30 states that c*harm is deceitful and beauty is **<u>vain</u>**,\[but\] a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.*

###### a. When a **<u>woman</u>** allows outward appearance to dominate her, she has difficulty focusing on what truly matters.

###### b. The women of the world operate under the illusion that maintaining external beauty is central to happiness. The truth is that **<u>true</u>** attractiveness comes from the internal beauty *of a gentle and quite spirit*.

##### 3. The believing wife who walks according to God's **<u>model</u>** as seen in these verses will be a blessing to everyone, especially to her husband and children.

#### e.1 Peter 3:4b-6 -- Relying on an Old Testament illustration, Peter continued his teaching on the **quiet [power</u>** of the submissive wife.

##### 1.1 Peter 3:4b -- God esteems as **<u>priceless</u>** a believing wife's gentle and quiet spirit.*With the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit,**which is precious in the sight of God**.*

##### 2.1 Peter 3:5 -- In the Old Testament, the matriarchs of the faith adorned themselves by willing subjection to their husbands.*For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to **<u>adorn</u>** themselves, being submissive to their own husbands;\*

##### 3.1 Peter 3:6a -- Sarah's faith in God exceeded her fears and allowed her to **<u>submit</u>** to Abraham.*Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.*

###### a. It is a **<u>fearful</u>** thing to submit to another human being, especially to a fellow sinner.

###### b.**<u>Sarah</u>** was an amazing example of a woman who struggled with her faith, i.e., laughing at God's promise, while in the same moment meekly honoring her very imperfect husband, Abraham, referring to him as,"*My lord*." Genesis 18:12-15

##### 4.1 Peter 3:6b -- Just as Abraham is the father of all who believe God's Word, Sarah is the mother of all wives who submit to their husbands without being vanquished by fear.*And you have become her **<u>children</u>** if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.*

###### a. Since this command to submit to your husband is God's command, you can be sure that if by **<u>faith</u>** you obey God, He will indeed take care of you and your children. You need not fear. You will have God's blessing. Psalm 56:11

###### b. With that said, if a husband puts his wife into a harmful or sinful situation, the wife has the right to **<u>obey</u>** God over and above her husband. In such a situation she has the right to refuse to submit. Exodus 1:17; Daniel 6:13; Acts 4:19,5:29

## B. Colossians 3:19 -- Teaching for the believing husband (Eph.5:25-33,1 Pet.3:7) 

### 1. Colossians 3:19 -- Paul gave two commands to the Christian **<u>husband</u>**.

#### a. Colossians 3:19a -- Paul\'s first command was **<u>positive</u>**: *Husbands love your wives*.

##### 1. The command for husbands to love their wives is clear and **<u>simple</u>**.

##### 2. Proverbs 30:21-23 makes a powerful statement: *Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up: a servant who becomes king, a fool who is full of food,**an [unloved</u> woman who is married**, and a maidservant who displaces her mistress.*

##### 3. The biblical command to love one's wife was extraordinary in a world where wives were often considered property and marriage a thing of **<u>social</u>** necessity, not love.

##### 4. Ever since the first century,**<u>love</u>** has been the Christian buzzword. Even today the command to love your wife easily becomes a cliché. Yet the command is not to be taken lightly.

##### 5. A believing husband cannot properly love without the enablement of the Spirit. You **<u>cannot</u>** love your wife by mere human determination.2 Corinthians 3:5

###### a. The word for love used here is AGAPAO. This is a Spirit-produced all-give-no-demand type of love. Galatians 5:22

###### b. Biblical love is a dynamic pursuit in which a husband actively **<u>trusts</u>** the Lord to love his wife through Him. Colossians 1:8, Romans 15:30

#### b. Colossians 3:19b -- Paul\'s **<u>second</u>** command was negative in nature, addressing a grave problem in many men: *Husbands*...*do not be embittered against them*.

##### 1. Simply put, the Christian husband must **<u>never</u>** treat his wife unkindly.

##### 2. The word translated *embittered* PIKRAINO speaks of bitterness,**<u>anger</u>**, exasperation or irritability.

###### a. Interestingly, this command is in the passive voice indicating that you are never to allow passive aggression to **<u>surge</u>** up within you and spill over toward your wife.

###### b. The command being in the passive voice speaks against **<u>innate</u>** bitterness. Some husbands will argue that a down-in-the-mouth attitude is just the way they are and they cannot help it. A husband's bitter attitude should never be projected onto his wife.

##### 3. This command must not be downplayed. Bitterness is a severe scourge in **<u>many</u>** Christian marriage relationships.

###### a. Sadly, this type of treatment of a wife destroys the very longings a husband has to have a supportive wife. A wife cannot be supportive under such **<u>duress</u>**.

###### b. Harsh or vindictive treatment feeds a wife's insecurities concerning her husband's **<u>love</u>** and acceptance of her.

##### 4. Paul gave no exceptions to this command. He gave a clear directive **<u>against</u>** being bitter toward your wife, no exceptions. There is never any good reason for the Christian husband to be hostile or harsh toward his wife.

### 2. Ephesians 5:25-33 -- In the parallel passage of Ephesians 5 Paul not only gave the command for husbands to love their wives, but also added **<u>two</u>** supporting principles on how to do so.

#### a. The need for a believing husband to love his wife is repeated **<u>three</u>** times in nine verses. It is interesting that the command is repeated three times. Could it be that men have a problem with this duty?

##### 1. Ephesians 5:25 --*Husbands,**<u>love</u> your wives***...

##### 2. Ephesians 5:28 --*Husbands ought also to **<u>love</u> their own wives** as their own bodies*...

##### 3. Ephesians 5:33 --*Each individual among you also is to **<u>love</u> his own wife** even as himself*...

#### b. Ephesians 5:25-27 -- The **first** supporting principle Paul gave in this passage for how a husband is to love his wife is ...*just as Christ loved the **<u>church</u>***.

##### 1. Ephesians 5:25a --*Just as Christ loved the **<u>church</u>**...* Christ loves the church based on grace, therefore His love for the church is unconditional and eternal.

###### a. Christ incessantly intercedes on **<u>behalf</u>** of His church. John 17:20-26, Romans 8:34, Hebrews 7:25

###### b. Christ straightforwardly **<u>reveals</u>** Himself and His plan to the church.1 Corinthians 2:6-10, Ephesians 3:3-5, Colossians 1:26-27

###### c. Christ provides rest and **<u>shares</u>** the burden of life with each of us individually in the church. Matthew 11:28-30

##### 2. Ephesians 5:25b --*Just as Christ*...*gave himself up for her*. Christ's love for the church is a completely **<u>self</u>**-sacrificing love. Christ gave His life for her.

###### a. Just as faith manifests itself through visible works, so also love is seen through **<u>actions</u>**. The way to communicate love to your wife is through tangible sacrifices for her benefit. John 3:16

###### b. In order for a Christian husband to give himself up for his wife just as Christ gave Himself up for the **<u>church</u>**, his love must come from divine origin not from feeble human effort.

###### c. The type of love a wife needs **<u>comes</u>** from a husband who lives by grace and dependence on the Lord.

##### 3. Ephesians 5:26 -- What is Christ's purpose in unconditionally loving His church? *So that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the **<u>word</u>***.

###### a. Just as Christ sanctifies and cleanses His church, Christian husbands ought to **<u>take</u>** responsibility for the spiritual well-being of their wives (and families).

###### b. A believing husband should be **<u>filled</u>** with the Word himself because only then will he be able to properly communicate it to his wife and children.

##### 4. Ephesians 5:27 -- What is Christ's ultimate goal in his love for the Church? *That He might present to Himself the church in all her **<u>glory</u>**, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless.*

###### a. A Christian husband should **<u>teach</u>** his household with the goal of seeing his wife and family live holy and blameless lives.

###### b. This kind of goal requires investment and the same selfless **<u>love</u>** that Christ demonstrates towards His church in sacrificing and continually working for her good.

###### c. It is easy for a husband to think **<u>only</u>** of himself and of his personal success in life. God calls the believing husband to go beyond and be nurturing in his love for his wife as Christ is for His church.

#### c. Ephesians 5:28-33 -- The **second** supporting principle Paul gave for how husbands are to love their wives is ***as their own [bodies</u>***.

##### 1. Ephesians 5:28 -- We know that one of the top priorities of every human is to take **<u>care</u>** of his or her own body.*So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself*.

###### a. God's command to you as a believing husband is for you to provide for and protect your wife as spontaneously and with as much **<u>urgency</u>** as you take care of yourself.

###### b. This level of love is impossible **<u>apart</u>** from divine enablement, so look to God in faith for this kind of love. Loving in this way is sure to make an incredible impact on your wife. Romans 2:4, Ephesians 2:7

##### 2. Ephesians 5:29 -- We know that Christ loves the church deeply and even now lives for her good.*For no one ever **<u>hated</u>** his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church.* John 13:34, Ephesians 5:2

###### a. When you are hungry, you get something to **<u>eat</u>**. When you are thirsty, you get something to drink. When you are tired, you go to bed and get some sleep.

###### b. When you are upset, you turn to things that provide you comfort. When your life is threatened, you protect yourself at all costs. That's the natural human **<u>way</u>** of being and that's how believing men are to care for their wives.

##### 3. Ephesians 5:30 -- Christ loves us individually ...*because we are members of His **<u>body</u>***.

###### a. Just like a person nourishes and cherishes his **<u>own</u>** body, Christ nourishes and cherishes us because we are members who make up his body.

###### b. In the next three verses, the apostle Paul explained how this concept applies to a Christian marriage and a husband's responsibility to **<u>love</u>** his wife as he loves himself.

##### 4. Ephesians 5:31 -- Paul quoted the key verse in the Bible that initially established the institution of marriage.*For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and **the two shall become one [flesh</u>***. Genesis 2:24

##### 5. Ephesians 5:32 -- The mystery of two different people melding together to form **<u>one</u>** body through marriage is a great mystery.*This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.*

##### 6. Ephesians 5:33 -- Although it is a great mystery, the fact that a husband and wife are one flesh is the reason a husband should love his wife to the same degree he loves himself.*Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his **<u>own</u>** wife even as himself*.

###### a. Rather than seeing his wife as a separate **<u>entity</u>**, a husband needs to clearly understand that he and his wife are one. Whatever he does toward her is ultimately done toward himself.

###### b. For this reason he should love his wife as **<u>himself</u>**, because after all, the two of them in God's eyes are one and the same.

### 3.1 Peter 3:7 -- Peter **<u>also</u>** taught on the responsibilities of the Christian husband.

#### a.1 Peter 3:7a -- Peter\'s first **<u>counsel</u>** was that husbands should *...live with \[their\] wives in an understanding way*.

##### 1. Peter did not say you must fully understand your wife. He said to live with your wife in an understanding **<u>way</u>**. How should a husband live with his wife? What kind of understanding should a husband have?

###### a. Husbands need to appreciate the fact that by God's **<u>design</u>** women do not think the same as men. That of course is a very good thing in marriage. Our world would be very one dimensional without the female perspective. Every husband needs his wife's point of view.

###### b. Although a husband should actively study his wife by engaged **<u>listening</u>**, he will never fully understand all her perspectives. At the same time, a believing wife's insights are very much needed by her husband.

###### c. If a believing husband knows his wife's mood swings, worries, triggers, needs, likes and dislikes, he can become a huge blessing to her. Instead of reacting negatively, he can **<u>learn</u>** to act in proactive love.

##### 2. In summary, listen carefully because you **<u>want</u>** to understand and get to know your wife. As you do, you will know what she likes and doesn't like and be able to cherish her in a way that is meaningful and speaks love to her.

#### b.1 Peter 3:7b -- Some people have misunderstood Peter's next advice to husbands.***<u>Live</u>** with your wives in an understanding way,**as with someone weaker, since she is a woman***. Let's interpret this statement.

##### 1. The intent of Peter in this statement is not some **<u>macho</u>** man concept that women are inferior to men.

##### 2. Peter is not saying that the wife is a **<u>vessel</u>** of disgrace to be disregarded. Quite the contrary.

##### 3. Peter's statement implies that just as with a valuable vessel, you ought to give greater attention to the way you **<u>treat</u>** her. When the words "fragile" are written across a package, it does not mean the package is less valuable, in fact it more often means quite the contrary.

##### 4. When a husband believes his wife is of great **<u>value</u>**, he will treat her accordingly.

#### c.1 Peter 3:7c -- Peter concludes his teaching to husbands saying,"***Show her honor** as a fellow **<u>heir</u>** of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.*"

##### 1.*Show her **<u>honor</u>**...* reiterates our interpretation of the fact that Peter was not teaching some Christian form of chauvinism. The wife is to be honored by the believing husband. Among religions, only biblical Christianity provides dignified respect for wives.

##### 2.*As a **fellow [heir</u>** of the grace of life...* A believing wife is a fellow heiress of God's grace.

###### a. In God's economy of grace, male and female are **<u>equal</u>**. The ground at the foot of the cross is level.*There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.* Galatians 3:28

###### b. There is **<u>unity</u>** when a husband honors his wife by loving her as he loves himself and a wife respects her husband and submits to his love and leading.

###### c. In this way husbands and wives function as one unit as they raise their families and serve the **<u>Lord</u>**.

##### 3.*So that \[their\] prayers may not be **hindered**...* Peter's directive to the Christian husband to treat his wife as *a fellow heir of the **<u>grace</u>** of life...* was very pragmatic, so that they could have an effective and unencumbered prayer life.

###### a. Your wife is a **<u>fellow</u>** member of the body of Christ. She is God's child just as you are, therefore she has equal access to the throne of grace in believing prayer. John 13:34,35

###### b. Sadly, when a believing husband does not give proper **<u>honor</u>** to the wife, their fellowship with God and each other gets hurt and their prayers go unanswered.

## C. Colossians 3:20 -- Teachings for believing children (Eph.6:1-3)

### 1. Colossians 3:20 --*Children, be obedient to your parents...* To believing children Paul gave __<u>one</u>__ small command with huge implications. Proverbs 6:20

#### a. Colossians 3:20a --*Children, be obedient...* The word *obedient* HUPAKOUO is a compound word made up of HUPO meaning under and AKOUO meaning to __<u>hear</u>__ or listen.

##### 1. In a literal sense,*obey* HUPAKOUO means to __<u>listen</u>__ with submission or to hear in subjection.

##### 2. By implication, this command means Christian children are to __<u>heed</u>__ their parents' commands as being under their authority.

##### 3. The command to obey is __<u>straightforward</u>__. The verb *obey* is in the present tense, active voice and imperative mood.

###### a. The present tense means that as a believing child you should obey __<u>right</u>__ away, not wait till you feel like it. As the saying goes,"Delayed obedience is disobedience."

###### b. The active __<u>voice</u>__ means that the obedience is to be a proactive response.

###### c. Lastly the imperative mood makes *obey* a __<u>direct</u>__ command from God, commanding the Christian child to positively comply.

#### b. Colossians 3:20 --*Children, be obedient **to your parents**.* Notice the plural word *parents* here. The command is for the believing child to be obedient to __<u>both</u>__ parents. Obviously broken homes make this difficult, but the spirit of this verse can be honored as the believing child trusts God.

#### c. Colossians 3:20 --*Children, be obedient to your parents **in**  __<u>all</u>__ **things**...*

##### 1. Children are to obey their parents in  __<u>every</u>__ way.

###### a. When a child is told to study, clean up, brush teeth, wash dishes, or anything else around the house, it is his or her job to obey  __<u>right</u>__ away.

###### b. Obedience in all things is the biblical  __<u>duty</u>__ of every believing child.

##### 2. At this point there is usually a question about unconditional obedience. What if your parents ask you to do something that is clearly  __<u>wrong</u>__? What is the Christian young person to do in such a situation?"

###### a. If your parents ask you to steal, lie, or  __<u>break</u>__ one of God's commands, you are to obey God rather than your parents. This would clearly be the exception not the rule. Acts 5:29

###### b. For a parent to ask a child to sin is rare, but it  __<u>might</u>__ happen. In such cases you, as a believer in Christ, would obey God's Word above the command of your parents, even if you were punished for it. As you honor the Lord, He will help you in difficult situations.(Study Daniel 3)

#### d. Colossians 3:20 --*Children, be obedient to your parents in all things,**for this is well-pleasing to the**   __<u>Lord</u>__.*

##### 1. The word *well-pleasing* EUARESTOS means fully agreeable. This means that God  __<u>loves</u>__ it when Christian children obey their moms and dads.

##### 2. Young believer, God wants you to obey this command by  __<u>faith</u>__ not feelings. It is His command to you and there is eternal value for you as you obey. You need to trust that whatever God commands you to do is best and good for you, and most of all it is pleasing to God.

##### 3. Positive responses to God's mandate will not only benefit you in the short term but will also set your life on a  __<u>path</u>__ of positive growth. Deuteronomy 5:16, Proverbs 6:20-23

##### 4. Submission to authority is one of the most important things you can  __<u>learn</u>__. It will not only bless you personally but will also help you in the future in your community, job, church, ministry, marriage and family. Proverbs 3:21-23, Exodus 20:12

### 2. Ephesians 6:1-3 -- Let's consider another passage in the New Testament concerning Christian __<u>children</u>__.

#### a. Ephesians 6:1 -- Paul essentially gave the  __<u>same</u>__ command to the Ephesian children as to the Colossians when he said,"*Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.*"

##### 1. Ephesians 6:1a --*Children obey...* Here we hear the same basic command to  __<u>obey</u>__ your parents restated.

##### 2. Ephesians 6:1b -- Paul added the phrase,"*In the  __<u>Lord</u>__*," to his command. This phrase sometimes creates questions.

###### a. This does not mean that you are to obey your parents only if they are Christians, as some have concluded. The command to obey has nothing to do with whether or not your  __<u>parents</u>__ are believers. You must obey them regardless of their spiritual state.

###### b. So what does *in the Lord* mean? *In the Lord* and as a believer are synonymous statements.*In the Lord* means because you  __<u>belong</u>__ to God.

###### c. Of course all children ought to obey their parents, but Paul and the apostles never sought to  __<u>correct</u>__ the unsaved multitudes. Their focus was always specifically on those who are *in the Lord*, speaking specifically of believers.

##### 3. Ephesians 6:1c -- We have the phrase ...*for this is  __<u>right</u>__.*

###### a. Simply put, this means that this is your Christian  __<u>duty</u>__, or the right thing to do. God's will for the young believer is obedience to parents.

###### b. While the command to obey is for  __<u>minors</u>__, the directive to honor your parents remains constant for life. Exodus 20:12

###### c. Once you get married, your loyalty is to change from your parents to your spouse. Implicitly the command to obey ends there, however as believers we should never  __<u>stop</u>__ honoring our parents. Genesis 2:24

#### b. Ephesians 6:2 -- Paul reiterated his command to Christian children by quoting from the Ten Commandments.  *__<u>Honor</u>__ your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise.*

##### 1. Unlike the command to obey, this command to honor our parents must be remembered until  __<u>death</u>__.

##### 2. It is interesting that the apostle did not tell children to honor their parents if they  __<u>deserve</u>__ it. All believers are to honor their parents because that is God's will for them.

#### c. Ephesians 6:3 -- The command to honor our parents comes with a blessed promise: *So that it may be well with you, and that you may  __<u>live</u>__ long on the earth.*

##### 1. In the wisdom of God, He not only gave children the commands to obey and to honor their parents, but above and beyond, he gave  __<u>two</u>__ enormous incentives for faithful compliance.

###### a. First, he promised that life would go  __<u>well</u>__ for the child who honored his or her parents.

###### b. Second, that child would go on to live a long  __<u>life</u>__ on the earth. Proverbs 3:1-2,4:10

##### 2. We probably all know of individuals who honored their parents but  __<u>died</u>__  young. Conversely we probably also know of some people who were dishonoring to their parents and lived to be very old. Why?

###### a. Simply put, situations like these are exceptions, not the  __<u>general</u>__  rule. The general principle remains that those who honor their parents have long prosperous lives while rebellion shortens a life.

###### b. Proverbs 3:1-2 --*My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart  __<u>keep</u>__  my commandments; for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.*

###### c. Your decision by faith to honor your parents will set you on a path to blessing in __<u>life</u>__. Proverbs 12:28

##### 3. Conclusion: Children are not  __<u>able</u>__  to obey this command consistently and with a proper attitude by human determination alone.

###### a. Believing children do well to trust the Lord for the strength to obey and honor their parents. Without God's enabling  __<u>grace</u>__  even the simplest commands are impossible. John 15:4-5

###### b. Young people, in your relationship with your parents you need to  __<u>trust</u>__ God to give you the desire and the power to honor and obey with a good attitude. Philippians 2:12-13

## D. Colossians 3:21 -- Teaching for believing parents (Eph.6:4)

### 1. Colossians 3:21 --*Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not **<u>lose</u>** heart*. Paul commanded parents not to create **discouragement** in their children.

#### a. Colossians 3:21a --***<u>Fathers</u>***(plural) can legitimately be translated either dads or parents. In Hebrews 11:23 the same Greek word is translated *parents*.

##### 1. From the context here in Colossians, it appears God is speaking to **<u>parents</u>**, both moms and dads, and not to dads (men) only.

##### 2. In Greek, the **<u>first</u>** word in a sentence often receives the emphasis. Paul wanted to get the attention of parents on this matter. Parents listen up and pay attention.

#### b. Colossians 3:21b --*Do not exasperate your **<u>children</u>***.*Exasperate* ERETHIZO is a present tense command coupled with the negation ME and means to stop provoking right away. The use of the present tense command leads us to the conclusion that provocation by parents was probably a current ongoing issue.

##### 1. The word *exasperate* ERETHIZO literally means to arouse,**<u>incite</u>**, challenge, kindle, or to make passionate. It can be either positive (2 Cor.9:2) or negative. Colossians 3:21

##### 2. Here *exasperate* ERETHIZO connotes the idea of passion by a direct challenge. For a **<u>parent</u>** to deliberately impassion a son or daughter is an affront to this command.

##### 3. The following examples are all possible translations of the word *exasperate* used in the negative sense; be **<u>hard</u>** on, embitter, hassle, harass, irritate, make resentful, nag, pick at, pick on, poke fun at, provoke, ride, or vex, to name just a few.

##### 4. Parent, you can so easily **<u>wound</u>** your child without realizing it by constant nagging or pressure. Even in an effort to do what is right, you could cause your child to have a broken spirit or even give up on life.

#### c. Colossians 3:21c -- Why not nag or ride our children in our parenting style? So *that they may not **<u>lose</u>** heart*.

##### 1.*Lose heart* ATHUMOS comes from A negation and THUMOS fierceness or **<u>passion</u>**. Through provocation, parents can literally take the fire (life) right out of their children.

###### a. A parent can unwittingly **<u>cause</u>** depression and a desire to give up in a child by burdensome provocations to be better, cooler, more athletic, more academic, or by comparisons with siblings, downing him or her in public, unrealistic goals or just by simply not listening.

###### b. If your child is constantly discouraged, this could be a **<u>sign</u>** that you have a major flaw in your parenting. As a parent ask yourself if you are putting excessive pressure on your child causing dejection and despondency?

##### 2. To summarize, parents are to be careful not to provoke their children, sending them down the dark slippery slope of **<u>despair</u>**. Psalm 6

### 2. Ephesians 6:4 -- Let's consider Paul's additional teaching on parenting from the book of Ephesians. Don't be the **<u>cause</u>** of **rebellion** in your child.

#### a. Ephesians 6:4a --*And, fathers* PATER ... Like the instruction on parenting in Colossians, this command is for both **<u>parents</u>** equally.

#### b. Ephesians 6:4b --*Do not provoke your children to **<u>wrath</u>***. Similar to the command from Colossians 3:21 to not awaken passion in your child, this command is against spurring your child on towards resentful anger (rebellion).

##### 1. The command is in the present tense, emphasizing that this was likely a persistent **<u>problem</u>** in the church back then just as it is in ours today.

##### 2. Parents are told not to be the cause of anger in the life of their children. The fact that God gave this command is proof enough that parents **<u>easily</u>** do this kind of thing.

##### 3. In Ephesians, rather than causing our children to lose heart, we are told not to provoke **<u>our</u>** children to anger or rebellion. The extremes of **implosion** from discouragement (Col.3:21) or **explosion** from angry rebellion (Eph.6:4) can both be possible results of errors in parenting.

##### 4. The word PARORGIZETE translated *provoke to wrath* holds the connotation of irritating someone to the **<u>point</u>** of anger, or inciting to anger.

#### c. In summary, we see that parents are to be very careful not to cause rebellion. By excessive pressure, hassling, harassing or nagging you can provoke your child to either despair or rebellion. So what **<u>are</u>** you to do?

###3. Ephesians 6:4 -- Be the guiding influence in your child's world. How?
-

#####3. Here in the book of Ephesians, Paul cut directly across the grain of the culture of the day by putting the responsibility of child-training directly on Christian **<u>parents</u>** rather than on tutors.

##### 4. Christian parents are to be the tutors and trainers PAIDAGOGOS to give correction to their **<u>own</u>** children. Deuteronomy 8:5; Proverbs 19:18,29:17; Hebrews 12:7

#### c. Ephesians 6:4e --*But bring them up in the discipline **and instruction***...

##### 1. The word *instruction* NOUTHESIA literally means to place instruction into the **<u>mind</u>**. NUOS means mind and TITHEMI means to put or to place.

##### 2.*Instruction* is typically the positive or informative **<u>side</u>** of training whereas *discipline* carries negative or corrective overtones. Instruction is more proactive whereas discipline is more reactive.

##### 3. You are to **<u>walk</u>** alongside your children and disciple them in a step-by-step manner. You are not just to tell them what to do. You are to show them how to live by your own example and through thoughtful explanations.2 Timothy 2:24-25

##### 4. Yelling at your children or getting **<u>upset</u>** with them when they make mistakes is called provoking, the very thing Paul prohibited. That is not the way to train your children.

##### 5. You are to teach your children what the Word of God says and carefully **<u>explain</u>** it to them in a way they can understand. Explain to them why you do what you do and why you believe what you believe. This is what is being communicated here.1 Thessalonians 2:10-12

##### 6. Many parents today have bought into the secular thought that you are to only give your kids entertainment. Therefore they do not encourage them in the things of the Lord unless they can do it in a fun way. This is **<u>wrong</u>** thinking.

#### d. Ephesians 6:4f --*But bring them up in the discipline and instruction **of the [Lord</u>**.*

##### 1. Don't lose the focus of Paul's instruction here. Paul's focus was not on the child but on the parent. He was teaching parents how to **<u>raise</u>** children.

###### a. Paul called parents to have their **<u>focus</u>** on the Lord. Deuteronomy 6:7

###### b. You will only be successful as a parent to the degree you walk by **<u>means</u>** of the wisdom of God's Word and the power of God's Spirit. Romans 12:2, Philippians 1:9, Colossians 1:9-10

##### 2. In wrap-up, our job as parents is to not discourage nor provoke our kids. We are to positively raise them in the **<u>ways</u>** of the Lord Jesus Christ in godly discipline and instruction. Genesis 18:19, Psalm 78:4

## E.**Colossians 3:22-25 -- Teaching for believing employees (Eph.6:5-8)**

### 1. Colossians 3:22a --*Slaves*... The word *slave* DOULOS is the word for bondman or **<u>servant</u>**.

#### a. In Bible times, if you were a slave, you were either a slave by **<u>choice</u>** or a slave by force. This term applied to both groups. The average day laborer in those days was a slave.

##### 1. In the Roman Empire, during the first century, nearly one in **<u>five</u>** people (approximately 12 million souls) were said to have been slaves.

##### 2. As you might imagine, the Roman economy depended heavily on this **<u>pool</u>** of forced-laborers.

##### 3. Slaves were both **<u>skilled</u>** and unskilled. It was not unusual for slaves to be lawyers, doctors, teachers, and other important professions, jobs that today would be considered far above the pay grade of slave labor.

#### b. Even though legalized slavery is generally a thing of the **<u>past</u>**, these biblical principles readily apply to **Christian employees** today. Since slaves constituted the work force of the ancient world, to apply this passage to our work force today is not a biblical stretch.

### 2. Colossians 3:22b --*Obey* is the standard **<u>word</u>** we find in this passage for slaves, and for our application, Christian employees. The believing employee's mission is to *obey \[his or her\] master.*

#### a. The word *obey* HUPAKOUO means HUPO under and AKOUO hear. Biblical obedience means **<u>listen</u>** as a subordinate.

#### b. In Colossians 3:20 this **<u>same</u>** word is used for children when they are commanded to obey their parents.

#### c. This is a present, active, imperative command emphasizing the **<u>need</u>** for believers to continually obey their earthly masters.

### 3. Colossians 3:22c -- Who is the employee to obey?

#### a.*Obey **<u>your</u>****masters** on earth*... The believing slave needed to obey his or her earthly master. Today we would encourage believing employees to faithfully comply with the instructions of their secular employers.

#### b.*Obey your masters **on [earth</u>***... The Holy Spirit probably added this to forbid Christian slaves from self-emancipating based on the teaching that they had no master but God.1 Corinthians 7:20-24

### 4. Colossians 3:22d-23 -- We can discern **<u>seven</u>** directives for slaves in this passage, and by way of application these should be a part of every Christian's work ethic.

#### a. Colossians 3:22d -- Be dependable: *Obey... in **<u>all</u>** things*... A Christian worker should obey always and in all ways. As we work, we are to willingly complete whatever tasks we are given, unless in doing so we would be breaking one of God's laws.

#### b. Colossians 3:22e -- Be diligent: *Obey... not with external service*... We are not to merely give an external **<u>show</u>**. God wants us to work diligently from a good attitude.

#### c. Colossians 3:22f -- Be faithful: *Obey...not as those who merely please men*... We are not to **<u>just</u>** perform as people-pleasers.

#### d. Colossians 3:22g -- Be honest: *Obey... with sincerity of **<u>heart</u>***... The word translated *sincerity* means uncomplicated. This directive counters duplicity of heart and communicates the need for honesty and integrity on the job.

#### e. Colossians 3:22h -- Be reverent: *Obey...**<u>fearing</u>** the Lord*... We are to obey based on a reverent fear of God. One day soon we are going to answer to God, not man, about how we lived our secular lives.

#### f. Colossians 3:23a -- Be enthusiastic: *Obey...**<u>heartily</u>**...* Whatever your task, work at it enthusiastically from the heart.*Heartily* has the thought of working both cheerfully and hard at the same time.

#### g. Colossians 3:23b -- Be principled: *Obey... as for the **<u>Lord</u>** and not for men.* In reality, as a believer, no matter what you do, you should be doing your responsibilities to please and honor God not people.

### 5. Colossians 3:24-25 -- Paul finished with a threefold motivation for slaves (employees) to be **<u>faithful</u>** in their obedience to their secular masters (employers).

#### a. Colossians 3:24a -- Employees should give faithful obedience based on knowledge of their **<u>future</u>**.*Obey knowing that from the Lord you **will receive** the reward of the inheritance*.

##### 1. Obey because you **<u>know</u>**, with all certainty, that whether or not you are rewarded here, God, your real Master, has already promised you an inheritance in heaven. This is not an "if" statement, it is a promise.

##### 2. The irony of this statement is that no **<u>slave</u>** received any inheritance in Roman life. This would have been an almost unbelievable statement to a slave in that day, but when embraced, it would have dramatically changed his or her perspective on present sufferings and on future glory. Hebrew 6:12

##### 3. Even though Paul spoke this truth directly to believing slaves, we can all **<u>claim</u>** this promise. All believers will receive from the Lord the reward of the inheritance. This is a positional truth with the promise of future glorification given as a **fact**.

#### b. Colossians 3:24b -- Employees should give faithful obedience based on knowing whom they are really serving.*Obey*...*knowing*...*it is the Lord Christ whom you serve*... It is always so important to understand that even in the secular realm we ultimately serve Christ and not **<u>man</u>**.

##### 1. Notice that Paul encouraged slaves to look **<u>past</u>** their earthly masters to the Lord Christ. This adjustment in focus would ensure proper motivation in day-to-day labor.

##### 2. The name for Jesus given here is *LORD CHRIST*. This is the only place this title for Jesus appears in the Bible and it is significant because a slave could fully identify with that phrase. As believers, slaves had a **<u>new</u>** master. The *Lord Christ* was their true master now that they were believers.

#### c. Colossians 3:25 -- Employees should give faithful obedience based on knowledge of the immediate consequences.*Obey ...*knowing...*he who does **<u>wrong</u>** will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.*

##### 1. Colossians 3:25a --*He who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done...* Notice Paul did not say that a slave would receive consequences **from the [Lord</u>**. That is not what this is saying.

###### a. We know that bad conduct on the part of the slave (employee) did not go without disciplinary **<u>action</u>** in that day and age. The book of Philemon is a great example of this fact.

###### b. Paul reminded slaves of their **<u>present</u>** reality, which in many ways holds true of employees today.

##### 2. Colossians 3:25b --*And that without partiality.* Paul gave a very pragmatic reason to be faithful in service. Just as a slave master would not let a slave off the **<u>hook</u>** for being unfaithful just because he was a Christian, your employer is not likely let you off the hook just because you are a believer.

###### a. At work, believers as well as unbelievers will receive the consequences they deserve for **<u>bad</u>** performance.

###### b. Obviously this does not take away from the **<u>truth</u>** of reward or loss of reward at the Judgment Seat of Christ for negligence in time.

## F.**Colossians 4:1 -- Teachings for believing employers (Eph.6:9)**

### 1. Colossians 4:1a --**<u>Masters</u>** KURIOS were slave owners. Although slave owners are essentially outlawed in the world today, this teaching clearly applies to business owners, employers and bosses who are over today's workforce.

#### a. Originally *master* or *lord* KURIOS was the word used to describe the **<u>gods</u>** of the Greek pantheon. In the New Testament the word *master* KURIOS is typically translated *Lord* when speaking of God, or *master* when speaking of humans. Matthew 24:28

#### b. Unlike English where *master* means one who is sovereign, or the person of uncontested power and ownership, in the New Testament when KURIOS is used of humans it means the person with **<u>legal</u>** authority over his property and slave workforce.

#### c. In this passage, the word is specifically used for slave owners, but the principles **<u>apply</u>** just as well to employers or bosses in our day.

### 2. Colossians 4:1b --*Grant to your slaves justice and fairness*... The mandate for employers is to *grant***<u>two</u>** fundamental rights.

#### a. Colossians 4:1b --*Masters **grant** to your slaves...* The word ***<u>grant</u>*** PARECHO is a present tense command that means to furnish, present, afford or exhibit. This word stressed the ongoing need of masters to provide for their workers.

##### 1. Clearly the master had the power to either provide or withhold **<u>good</u>** from his subordinates.

##### 2. By way of application, God would have Christian employers grant (**<u>offer</u>** or afford) their employees two rights.

#### b. Colossians 4:1c --*Masters grant...**<u>justice</u>**...* Paul instructed believing masters to give justice to their workers.

##### 1. Justice DIKAIOS comes from the word DIKE meaning correct in the fulfillment of **<u>duties</u>**. In the New Testament *justice* came to mean correctness that accords with God's standards or requirements, not merely with the requirements of society.

##### 2. Paul commanded that believing masters **<u>treat</u>** their workers by God's standards, not human standards. They were to be objective and unbiased in their dealings with their workforce.

##### 3. This would have been a radical change of thinking for Christian masters in Paul's day. It should also affect how Christian employers treat their **<u>workers</u>**.

##### 4. Because of a tendency the world over to be inequitable, government agencies have been formed to regulate industry and enforce justice for employees. In light of Paul's command here, a **<u>believing</u>** employer should readily go above and beyond the requirements of government.

#### c. Colossians 4:1d --*Masters grant...**<u>fairness</u>**...* The word *fairness* ISOTES literally means likeness in proportions. By implication *fairness* means impartiality or equality.

##### 1. As believers we should realize that nationality,**<u>race</u>**, ethnicity, or any other supposed distinction should never be a factor in how people are treated.

##### 2. This verse fits very neatly with the last phrase in Colossians 3:25 that states,"*And that without partiality*." Fairness **<u>equates</u>** with impartiality.

##### 3. In light of this Scripture, Christian employers should seek to **<u>treat</u>** their employees with equality.

### 3. Colossians 4:1e --***Knowing** that you too have a **<u>Master</u>** in heaven*. Because of chapter breaks we sometimes lose continuity in our studies.

#### a. The phrase *and that without partiality* in Colossians 3:25 neatly **<u>ties</u>** in with the spirit of this command to Christian masters. They too served the *Lord Christ*.

#### b. In terms of one's standing in the church, masters were not **<u>over</u>** the slaves they owned, and Paul reminded them of that fact. Often in churches today wealthy employers and business owners demand or receive respect above that of common workers in the body. This contradicts the spirit of this teaching.

#### c. Christianity was totally radical in the first century world as it should be today. It was totally possible that a slave could have become an **<u>elder</u>** in the church and his earthly master could have become a sheep under his spiritual care.

### 4. Colossians 4:1f --*Knowing that you **<u>too</u>** have a master in heaven*. Paul sought to correct the motivations of Christian masters or employers.

#### a. The Christian employer has a heavenly onlooker, God, who judges and observes all his **<u>actions</u>** toward his subordinates.

#### b. As a Christian employer, cognizance of the fact that God is your boss should cause you to relate to all your subordinates with **<u>equity</u>** and equality. Philippians 4:5

### 5. In conclusion, Paul\'s **<u>commands</u>** to masters and servants could be summarized in employee employer relationship as follows:

#### a.**<u>Employers</u>**, keep in mind that God rules over you just as you rule over your employees. God knows if you are just and fair in your business practices or not. He expects impartiality.

#### b.**<u>Employees</u>**, God asks you to genuinely obey your boss. He expects you to work as though you were working for Christ not an earthly boss, keeping in mind that one day Christ will bless you with an inheritance that is out of this world.

# VI.**Colossians 4:2-7 -- Changed Lives Through the Word of Christ**

## A.**Colossians 4:2-4 -- Refreshing our prayer lives**

### 1. Colossians 4:2 -- How should believers pray? Paul would say,"Pray earnestly, watchfully, and gratefully."

#### a. Colossians 4:2a --*Devote yourselves to prayer*... We are to **<u>pray</u>** with consistency. We are to be fervent in our prayer lives.

##### 1.***<u>Devote</u>*** PROSKARTEREO carries the overtone of perseverance or persistence. Six of the ten uses of this word in the New Testament are in association with prayer. Acts 1:14,2:46,6:4; Romans 12:12; Ephesians 6:18

##### 2. Paul's most fascinating use of the word *devoted* PROSKARTEREO is found in Romans 13:6 where it describes the unceasing activity of government **<u>tax</u>** collectors. Just as tax collectors did not (and do not) give up on their task of tax collecting, we should not give up on our task of prayer.

##### 3.*Devote* is a present tense imperative showing that prayer for the believer is to be a constant part of **<u>life</u>**.

#### b. Colossians 4:2b --*Keeping **<u>alert</u>** in it*... We are to be intentionally vigilant and watchful in prayer.

##### 1. To be *watchful* GREGOREUO means to waken or **<u>rouse</u>** from sleep. It has the idea of being ready for danger or emergency, to be on the lookout.

##### 2. The kind of prayer Paul wanted for the Colossians was vigilant prayer, because he knew the **<u>dangers</u>** that surrounded them. They were being bombarded by the heresies that he addressed in chapter two. This was not the time to sleep; they needed to be on guard duty. Luke 21:36

##### 3. When you rouse yourself you force yourself to be awake. That's what is being implied here. We can so easily take a laidback stance in our Christianity, so Paul reminded the Colossian believers to instead be wide-awake and on high **<u>alert</u>** in their praying.

##### 4. Perhaps one of the greatest needs for all believers in their prayer lives is to be spiritually **<u>engaged</u>**.1 Timothy 2:1-4,1 Peter 4:7

###### a. Prayer for what is going on in our families, churches, communities, lives and government is always a **<u>top</u>** priority for us as believers.1 Thessalonians 5:17

###### b. Being watchful implies specific and purposeful prayer. Through this Scripture, the Holy Spirit is warning us not to be asleep, half-hearted or vague in our prayer **<u>lives</u>**. Ephesians 6:18

##### 5. Do you realize the solemn importance of prayer?

#### c. Colossians 4:2c --*With \[an attitude of\] thanksgiving*... An **<u>attitude</u>** of heartfelt appreciation to God, should overflow into thankfulness in our prayers.

##### 1. True thankfulness or the lack thereof in our prayers is very revealing of **<u>where</u>** we are in our spiritual growth.

###### a. Thankfulness shows your appreciation for what God has already done for you in the **<u>past</u>**. Colossians 1:3-4

###### b. Thankfulness shows your contentment and peace in accepting whatever God has for you in the **<u>present</u>**. Romans 5:3-5, Colossians 4:12-13

###### c. Thankfulness shows your confidence in God and His sovereign control over your **<u>future</u>**. Only Christians can thank God in advance for what He will do because we know that whatever the outcome, He does everything well. Mark 7:37, John 11:41-43, Ephesians 6:18

##### 2. Paul did not say to be thankful if all goes **<u>our</u>** way.1 Thessalonians 5:18

###### a. Even when the outcome seems less than desirable, we are assured by God that He works all things together for our **<u>good</u>**. Romans 8:28,31; Colossians 1:12

###### b. Have we learned to trust God regardless of the outcome of our prayers? Ephesians 3:20-21

### 2. Colossians 4:3-4 -- Even though Paul was a great missionary set apart by God, he was keenly aware of his personal **<u>need</u>** for prayer support. Paul knew that without God's direct intervention he could do nothing of eternal value. Acts 20:24,2 Corinthians 3:4-5,2 Thessalonians 3:1-2,1 Timothy 1:12

#### a. Colossians 4:3a --*Praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word*. Paul asked the Colossians to pray for an open **<u>door</u>** to speak forth God's Word.

##### 1. If we were in prison, we'd also ask the Lord for an **<u>open</u>** door, but it would be to escape, not to speak. Acts 14:27

##### 2. Instead, Paul's petition was for evangelistic opportunities. We know of at least **<u>one</u>** case where God answered this prayer in Onesimus, the runaway slave from Colossae. Colossians 4:9, Philemon 1:10-13

#### b. Colossians 4:3b --*So that we may **<u>speak</u>** forth the mystery of Christ.* God had commissioned Paul to make known the mystery of Christ. Paul asked the Colossian believers to pray that God would open up opportunities to accomplish this goal. Romans 1:14-17,16:25; 1 Corinthians 9:16-17; Philippians 1:18-20

#### c. Colossians 4:3c --*For which I have also been imprisoned*. Paul considered himself to be incarcerated because of the *mystery of Christ*. He willingly suffered for the Gospel's **<u>sake</u>**.2 Timothy 1:8, Hebrews 13:3

#### d. Colossians 4:4a --*That I may make it clear*... Paul also wanted them to pray for **<u>clarity</u>** in speaking the *mystery of Christ*, the Gospel message. The mystery of Christ has to be believed by the unsaved for justification and by the saved for sanctification. Clarity in preaching is so important to accurate understanding.

#### e. Colossians 4:4b --*In the way I ought to speak.* The apostle Paul asked for prayer that he would be **<u>faithful</u>** to the task God had given him. What a testimony and what a challenge for us as well. Ephesians 6:18-20

## B.**Colossians 4:5-6 -- Revitalizing our public testimonies**

### 1. Colossians 4:5a --*Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders*. Paul gave an important command concerning the believer's behavior before unbelievers. He instructed believers to walk blamelessly **<u>before</u>** the world.

#### a. We should understand that **<u>our</u>** testimony before the world does indeed matter.

#### b.*Conduct yourself* is a present tense active voice imperative emphasizing that this should be **<u>done</u>** as a normal part of everyday life.

#### c.*With wisdom* is more than mere knowledge. Wisdom is divine understanding that prompts us how to properly **<u>apply</u>** what we know to our everyday situations. We desperately need God's wisdom as we order our lives before the world.

### 2. Colossians 4:5b-6 -- Paul now pointed out three areas in which we should live **<u>wisely</u>** before the world.

#### a. Colossians 4:5a -- Be wise in your **<u>walk</u>**. First, we are to *make the most of the opportunity*. We are to snatch up daily opportunities to minister to the world.

##### 1. The phrase *making the most of* EXAGORAZO literally means to buy out of or to redeem (as when something is purchased out from the **<u>market</u>** place).

##### 2. This commercial term pictured the savvy shopper who seizes a **<u>deal</u>** when he or she sees one. Just as a shopper grabs a bargain at the right time, so the Christian is to seize opportunities to share Christ with unbelievers.

#### b. Colossians 4:6a -- Be sharp in your **<u>talk</u>**. Second,*let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt*. We are to be wise in our interaction with the unsaved world.

##### 1. Our speech should always ...*be with **<u>grace</u>***. As a believer your communication before the world should be winsome at all times. In this world a pleasant word spoken at the right time will give you opportunities and open doors that lead to evangelistic opportunities. Proverbs 15:23,25:11

##### 2. This world is an unsavory place. Your speech with unsaved friends and neighbors should be *seasoned as it were with **<u>salt</u>***. Pack your words with the undiluted flavor of the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

#### c. Colossians 4:6c -- Be ready, don't **<u>balk</u>**. Third,...*so that you may know how you should respond to each person.* Your circumspect walk before the world will give you opportunities and God will supply the words. James 1:5,2 Timothy 4:17

# VII.**Colossians 4:7-18 -- Closing Comments, Commendations and Concerns**

## A.**Some general observations about the people Paul esteemed**

### 1. Paul mentioned all kinds of believers: Jews and Gentiles,**<u>male</u>** and female, and slave and free. This highlights the unity that exists in the body of Christ in spite of the diversity. Ephesians 2:11-22, Galatians 3:26-28

### 2.**<u>Each</u>** of the people mentioned was significant in some way to the Colossian church.

### 3. If Christ were writing a letter to your church, what would His comments concerning you be? To God, these individuals were more than just a number. Do you see yourself as more than a **<u>number</u>** to our God?

## B.**Colossians 4:7-15a -- Paul's kind regards to and from individuals of high esteem**

### 1. Colossians 4:7-8 -- Tychicus'**<u>name</u>** meant **fortunate**. True to his name, this brother was an opportune and favorable messenger for Paul.

#### a. Colossians 4:7a --*As to all my affairs, Tychicus...* Tychicus was a Gentile believer from the province of Asia and therefore he would have been familiar with the customs, mindset, culture and **<u>needs</u>** of the Colossians believers. Paul made a wise decision in choosing him to be the bearer of the Colossian letter. Acts 20:4

#### b. Colossians 4:7b --*Our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord*... As a beloved and faithful bondservant of Christ, Tychicus was considered by Paul to be a dear **<u>friend</u>** and soul-mate in every respect.

#### c. Colossians 4:7c --...*will bring you information*. These comments would be reason to carefully **<u>listen</u>** to him upon his arrival. Tychicus was going to share with them more information from Paul.

#### d. Colossians 4:8 --*For I have sent him to you for this very **<u>purpose</u>**, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts*... Paul was sure Tychicus would answer their questions and encourage their hearts. Ephesians 6:21; 2 Timothy 2:2,4:12; Titus 3:12

### 2. Colossians 4:9 -- Onesimus' name meant **useful**. Interestingly he had been a worthless **<u>slave</u>** but became **useful** to Paul in the ministry. Philemon 10-21

#### a. Colossians 4:9a --*And with him Onesimus*... Onesimus was a Gentile believer from the **<u>town</u>** of Colossae. Colossians 4:12

#### b. Colossians 4:9b --*Our faithful and beloved brother, who is **<u>one</u>** of your number*. Onesimus was a runaway slave who had been converted and changed by God's grace under Paul's prison ministry. As a testament to the transforming power of the Gospel, Paul now considered him to be a faithful and dear brother. Philemon 16

#### c. Colossians 4:9c --*They will inform you about the whole situation here*. Onesimus was to be a traveling companion of Tychicus. He would turn himself over to his **<u>legal</u>** owner, Philemon, when he arrived at Colossae. Together with Tychicus, he would also report to the church concerning Paul's prison sufferings.

### 3. Colossians 4:10-11 -- Paul mentioned other important believers who also **<u>sent</u>** their greetings to the church in Colossae.

#### a. Colossians 4:10a -- Aristarchus' name meant **best ruler**. Aristarchus was a Jewish believer from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia who had a **<u>Greek</u>** name. He was a fellow believer who was suffering in chains together with Paul.

##### 1. Aristarchus knew what it meant to **<u>suffer</u>** for Christ. Once, in the city of Ephesus, he was seized by an angry mob during a riot. Acts 19:29

##### 2. At the time of this writing, he was in prison for his **<u>faith</u>**. The word for fellow-prisoner means fellow prisoner-of-war. This implied that he was arrested by sword as if taken in war. Acts 27:2-4

##### 3. Paul told Timothy,"If we endure, we will also **<u>reign</u>** with Him." True to his name **Best Ruler**, in eternity Aristarchus' suffering will surely result in **ruling** authority. Acts 19:29,20:4; 2 Timothy 2:12a

#### b. Colossians 4:10b -- Mark's name meant polite or **shining**. Mark had been a rude quitter who became a **bright shining****<u>worker</u>**. Acts 12:25

##### 1. Mark, also called John Mark, was the **<u>cousin</u>** of Barnabas. He was the cause of the split in Paul and Barnabas' missionary team. Acts 15:37-39

##### 2. By the **<u>grace</u>** of God, in the end Mark totally turned around and became a faithful servant and a useful fellow worker of the apostle Paul.2 Timothy 4:11, Philemon 24

##### 3. Mark ended up being the author of the gospel of Mark. Here Paul admonished the Colossians to welcome him should he **<u>come</u>**. Why?

##### 4. It could be that they had heard of his previous dereliction of duty and Paul was afraid they might **<u>reject</u>** him if he were to visit.

#### c. Colossians 4:11a --*Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings*. Justus\' name meant **righteous**. Justus was a Jewish believer in Christ who became one of Paul's **<u>fellow</u>** workers. There are a few possibilities in Scripture for the identity of this **righteous** man.

##### 1. First, he may have been Joseph, called Barsabas (Justus), the runner-up to being the replacement for **<u>Judas</u>**. Acts 1:23

##### 2. Second, he may have been Titus Justus the Corinthian worshiper of **<u>God</u>**, who was likely a Jewish proselyte before His faith in Christ. Acts 18:7

##### 3. Third, an otherwise unknown Jewish **<u>man</u>** who was neither of the above.

##### 4.**<u>Any</u>** of these options would meet the qualification of being Jewish.

#### d. Colossians 4:11b --*These are the only **<u>Jews</u>** among my co-workers...* For some unknown reason, Justus, Aristarchus and Mark were the only Jewish Christians who were working together with Paul at the time of his imprisonment in Rome.

#### e. Colossians 4:11c --*For the kingdom of God...* Paul was not saying they were presently establishing the Kingdom, but he understood that the work we do now in the **<u>Church</u>** Age is a contribution to the coming Kingdom of God. Colossians 1:13

##### 1. In 2 Timothy 4:18 Paul shed some light on this when he said,"*The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed, and will **<u>bring</u>** me safely to his heavenly kingdom*." One day Paul would be taken to the future kingdom.

##### 2. Also in Acts 14:22b Paul said,"*Through many tribulations we must **<u>enter</u>** the kingdom of God*." The kingdom is yet future and we will enter it.

#### f. Colossians 4:11b --*And they have proved a comfort to me*. Paul confessed that these three Jewish Christians had been a true encouragement and **<u>help</u>** to him.

### 4. Colossians 4:12-13 -- Epaphras' name meant charming or **lovely**. Epaphras was a prayer warrior with a pastor's **<u>heart</u>**, and there is nothing more **lovely** than that.

#### a. Colossians 4:12a --*Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ sends you his greetings ...* Epaphras was from the Colossian congregation and was very likely the key **<u>person</u>** in the evangelism and establishment of the church. Colossians 1:7

#### b. Colossians 4:12b --*\[He is\] always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers...* Epaphras was the **<u>only</u>** believer the apostle Paul ever singled out as a prayer warrior.

##### 1. Prayer for their spiritual growth -- He prayed ...*that \[they\] may stand perfect...* This is similar in focus to Paul's prayers for them in Colossians 1:9-12. Epaphras prayed for their ***perfection***, meaning that they would reach their full **<u>goal</u>**, be finished, and achieve all the fullness that God wanted for them.

##### 2. Prayer for their spiritual understanding -- Epaphras also prayed that they'd be *...**<u>fully</u>** assured in all the will of God.* The issue of *full assurance of understanding* concerning God's will was also a focus in Paul's prayers for the Colossians. Colossians 1:9,2:1-3

##### 3. Why pray for these two issues? Why not pray for needs like better jobs, better health, a better political climate, or financial security?

##### 4. Epaphras prayed this way simply because if God would **<u>grant</u>** these two areas of spiritual growth and understanding, he knew they would thrive and be fruitful for God's sake and glory regardless of their lot in life.

#### c. Colossians 4:13 --*For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis*. Epaphras had a **<u>real</u>** passion for the well-being of the Colossians and their sister churches in the Lycos valley.

### 5. Colossians 4:14 --*Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings*. Luke\'s name meant **light-giving**. Luke was a medical doctor who became a beloved companion of the apostle Paul on his journeys. He indeed **brightened** Paul's **<u>life</u>** with his company. Luke was also a careful historian. He wrote the books of Luke and Acts.

### 6. Colossians 4:14 -- Demas\' name meant **popular**. Demas is mentioned **<u>three</u>** times in the New Testament. Although Demas was at this point a devoted worker, later, when it was no longer **popular** or convenient to be a Christian, his love for the world returned. Colossians 4:14, Philemon 24,2 Timothy 4:10

### 7. Colossians 4:15a --*And also Nympha and the church that is in her house*... Nympha, a sister in the Lord whose name meant **bride,** hosted a local congregation, the **bride** of Christ, in her **<u>home</u>**.

#### a. In those days, churches often met in **<u>homes</u>**. For Nympha to host the congregation in her home would have been a great honor as well as responsibility. Romans 16:5,1 Corinthians 16:19, Philemon 2

#### b. Church buildings were not utilized **<u>until</u>** around the third century AD.

## C. **Colossians 4:15b-18 -- Paul made some [farewell</u> statements.**

### 1. Colossians 4:15b -- A **G**reeting to the churches of Laodicea: ***<u>Greet</u>** the brethren who are in Laodicea.*

### 2. Colossians 4:16 -- An **O**bligation to **<u>read</u>** the Word: *When this letter is **read** among you, have it also **read** in the church of the Laodiceans and you, for your part **read** my letter that is coming from Laodicea.* The letter coming from Laodicea was probably the book of Ephesians that would eventually make its way to Colossae.

### 3. Colossians 4:17 -- An **O**rder for Archippus to **<u>fulfill</u>** his ministry: *Say to Archippus,"Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it."* We do not know what ministry Archippus had, but he needed encouragement to accomplish it. Sometimes we also need encouragement to do our responsibilities.

### 4. Colossians 4:18a -- A **D**elineation: **<u>Paul\'s</u>** personal signature.*I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand*. This personal touch was Paul's way of preventing forgeries. In those days, this was sometimes a problem.1 Corinthians 16:21; 2 Thessalonians 2:2,3:17

### 5. Colossians 4:18b -- A **B**urden to share: *Remember **<u>my</u>** imprisonment.* Romans 12:15, Hebrews 13:3

### 6. Colossians 4:18c -- A **Y**earning for them to enjoy the **<u>grace</u>** of God: *Grace be with you*. The apostle Paul desired that God's unmerited favor and undeserved kindness be on them. Amen!
