Daniel	was	a	sinner	saved	by	grace.	At	least	that’s	the	way	he	would	likely	have	described	himself.	

From	childhood,	most	of	us	have	heard	we	should	be	like	Daniel,	as	if	it	is	a	question of	simply	studying his	life,	making	a	few	adjustments,	and	suddenly	having	his	level	of	maturity.	While	that’s	an interesting	and	noble	concept,	it’s	not	how	to	become	like	Daniel. But	we	can	begin	by	imitating	Daniel’s	faith.	

Like	Timothy,	Daniel	was	well	acquainted	with the	scriptures,	and	he	believed	what	was	written
therein.	Daniel	was	indeed	a	man	whose	life	exemplified	implicit	trust	in	God.	We	can	see	his	reliance on	God	in	virtually	every	chapter;	Daniel’s	unconditional	faith	in	God	and	His	word	resulted in	amazing exploits.	So,	while	it	is	true	we	should	copy	Daniel,	it	is	his	dependence	on	God	in	every	situation	we should	imitate.

It	is	doubtful	Daniel’s	parents	had	any	indication	Daniel	would	become	an	important	person	in	a	
foreign	land,	on	the	level	of	Moses	and Joseph.	They	probably	lost	all	hope	when	he	was	cruelly	
snatched	away	from	them	and	taken	captive.	But	God	was	in	control	and	preserved	this	young	man,	
body	and	soul,	from	the	ravages	of	an	evil	world	system.	God	is	good	and	God	is	all-powerful;	Daniel	
proved	this	true.

#### THE 	BOOK 	OF 	DANIEL

**_UNDERSTANDING	THE	TIMES	OF	THE	GENTILES_**

**I. Our	Approach	to	the	Study	of	the	Book	of	Daniel**


A. Long	ago	God	chose	Old	Testament	prophets	to	receive	and	promulgate key	
parts	of	His	future	plan for	Israel	and	the	world.	The	biblical	study	of	these	end	
time	events	is	called	eschatology.

1. Eschatology	is	derived	from	the	Greek	words	ESCHATOS,	meaning	last,	and	LOGOS,	meaning	
    **word** ,	or	rational	statement.
    a. Thus, eschatology	is	the	biblical	study	of the	 **last** things,	or	the	end	times.
    b. Not	 **every** prophecy	in	the	Bible	relates	to	the	last	things.	2	Kings	4:43- 44	
    c. Eschatology	is	a	specific	category	within	the	broader	 **study** of	biblical	prophecy.
2. As	we	study	Daniel	it	is	important	to	understand	the	difference	between	 **general** revelation	
    and	special	revelation.
    a. General	revelation	is	the	 **universal** ,	nonverbal	communication	of	God’s	existence	
       through	His	creation.	Night	and	day	creation	declares	the	existence	of	God.	Psalm	19:1-
       6,	Romans	1:18- 20	
    b. Special revelation refers	specifically	to	God’s	 **written** word.	
       1) Special	revelation	was direct communication	from	God	to His	chosen	prophets	
          through	the	 **inspiration** of	the	Holy	Spirit. 2	Peter	1:19- 21	
       2) God	preserved	special	revelation	by	having	these	prophets	 **write** down	His	message	
          as	compiled	in the	Bible.	Psalm	19:7-11,	Hebrews	1:1-2,	2	Timothy	3:16- 17	
3. The	New	Testament,	especially	the	book	of	Revelation,	 **expands** upon	God’s	special	
    revelation	of	future	events recorded	by	the	prophets	of	the	Old	Testament.
4. Much	of	the	imagery	used	by	Old	Testament	prophets	like	 **Daniel** ,	Zechariah and	Ezekiel	is	
    not	only	repeated,	but	often more	fully	developed,	in	the	book	of	Revelation.

**B. Why	bother	with	eschatology?**

1. It	is	estimated	that	27%	of	God’s	written	word	is	 **prophetic** in	nature.	Since	God	devoted almost	a	third	of	the	 **Bible** to prophecy,	prophecy	is	clearly	a	crucial	aspect	of	His revelation.	
    a. If	we	disregard	the	prophetic	portions of	 **God’s** word, we	are	not	 _accurately	_
       _handling the	word	of	truth_ .	2	Timothy	2:






b. In	Revelation	1:3,	God	promises	to	 bless those	who	read	and	understand	Revelation,	a	
major book	of	prophecy.

2. There	are	great	 **benefits** derived	from	studying	biblical	prophecy.


a. Studying	Bible	prophecy	helps	you gain	a	more	complete	 understanding of	the	message	
of	the Bible. Jeremiah	15:
1) If	you	fail	to	understand	Bible	 prophecy ,	you	will	likely	misunderstand	and	misapply	
much	of	the	Old	and	New	Testaments.	Mark	7:5-9,	Titus	3:
2) Christ is	the	subject	of	many	of	the	prophecies	in	the	Bible.	In	fact,	the	first	and	last	
prophecies	in	the	Bible	center	on	Christ. Genesis 3:15, Revelation	19:
a) Therefore,	to	 ignore prophecy	would	be	to	ignore	essential	revelation	regarding	
the	central	person	of	the	Bible,	our	Lord	and	Savior	Jesus	Christ.	Revelation	1:
b) Already-fulfilled	prophecy	revealed	Christ’s	First	Advent,	His	sufferings,	glory,	
death,	and	resurrection.	Similarly,	end	times	prophecy	reveals	Christ’s	Second	
Advent	and	His	future	 reign as	king.
3) From	prophecy, we also learn	of	Israel’s	past,	present	and	 future .	
a) We	learn	of	Israel’s	dispersion	and	ultimate	return	to	the	 land.
b) We	learn	of	Israel’s	 role in	redemption.	
c) We	also	learn	that	 Israel will	one	day	be	the	premiere	nation	on	earth	and	will	
have	a	literal	earthly	kingdom.	
b. A	proper	understanding	of	Bible	prophecy	helps	you	understand	the present time.	1	
Chronicles	2:32,	Matthew	16:2- 3	
1) From	prophecy,	we	can	predict	the	final	outcome	of	the	rule	of	man	on	earth.	
Daniel	4:25,	Revelation	11:
2) By	means	of	prophecy	believers in	the	past	were	able	to	know	what	was	going	to	
happen	before	it	happened.	In	the	same	way,	we	also	can	 predict the	future	arrival	
of	a	powerful	man	who	will	be	satanic	and	evil	beyond	any	other	despot	to	ever	
live. Daniel	7:8-11,	25;	2	Thessalonians	2:3-4;	Revelation	13:
c. Understanding	biblical	prophecy	protects	you	from	being	led	 astray ,	deceived	or	even	
perplexed	by	false	teachers.	2	Thessalonians	2:1-2,	5;	2	Peter	3:17- 18	
d. A	major	motivation	for	service	depends	on	your	view	of	prophecy.	For	example,	if	you	
believe	in	the	trustworthiness	of	Bible	prophecy	concerning	the	imminent	return	of	
Christ,	you	will	live	 wisely , realizing	that	even	today	you	could	be	snatched	away	to	
heaven. 1	Thessalonians	4:13-18,	Revelation	1:
e. A	biblical	understanding	of	prophecy	reinforces	your confidence	in	God’s	 sovereignty .	
Daniel	2:20- 22		
1) As	the	all-powerful,	all-knowing	 Creator ,	God	has	a	detailed	plan for	human	history.	
Psalm	33:10-11,	Acts	2:23,	Ephesians	1:4,	1	Peter	1:

2) God	has	the	 power to	manage	the	events	of	the	end	times	so that they	unfold	
exactly	as	He	programed	and	foretold.	Job	42:2,	Psalm	115:3,	Isaiah	14:27,	25:1,	
Daniel	4:34- 35	
3) Our	eternal	and	infinite	Creator	has	had	the	knowledge	of	 exactly how	things	will	
turn	out	since	before	the	world	began.	
a) God	knows	 all that	ever	happened,	all	that	is,	and	all	that	ever	will	be.	Isaiah	
46:10,	Psalm	147:
b) God	equally	knows	all	that	 could have	happened, but	never	will.	1	Samuel	23: 6 -
14,	Matthew	11:21- 22	
f. Fulfilled	prophecy	is	the	most	powerful	and	conclusive	 evidence that	the	Word	of	God	is	
inspired	and	infallible.	It	is	estimated	that	200	prophecies	concerning	the	first	coming	of	
Christ	were	fulfilled with	100%	accuracy.	In	light	of	such	amazing	accuracy,	we	can	be	
certain	the	prophecies	of	His	second	coming	will	also	be	literally	and	accurately	fulfilled.
g. Understanding	prophecy	is	at	the	heart	of	the	study	of	the	book	of	 Daniel .	In	fact,	
without	Daniel, you	cannot	properly understand	the	book	of	Revelation.

**C. God	wants	us	to	understand	prophecy	concerning	end	times.**

1. The	 **science** of	Bible	interpretation, called	hermeneutics, is	what	we	use	to	arrive	at	a	good	
    interpretation of	scripture,	including	prophecy.
2. Much	confusion	about	Bible	prophecy	could	be	avoided	by	using	 **solid** procedures	for	
    interpreting	scripture.
3. Our	goal	in	interpreting	all	scripture, and	especially	Bible	prophecy, is	 **accuracy** (2	Tim.
    2:15).	Therefore,	we	must	seek	to	interpret	the	Bible	literally,	historically	and	
    grammatically.		Where	we	are	faithful	to	apply	good	principles, we	will	likely	get	it	right.

**D. Let’s	consider	a	few	basic	principles of	Bible	interpretation	(hermeneutics). A	**

**good	grasp	of	these	will	help	you	correctly	understand	eschatological	passages.**

1. The	first	step	to	understanding	a	passage	is	 **observation**. What	does	the	text	say?
    a. In	order	to	accurately	understand	a	passage	of	scripture,	you	must	familiarize	yourself	
       with	the **context** of	the	passage.	Therefore,	it	is	imperative	to	carefully	read	the	entire	
       biblical	book	in	which	the	passage	is	found.
    b. Next	you	need	to	establish	the	 **historical** setting	of	the	passage	at	hand.	Ask	yourself	
       some	basic	questions.
       1) **When** was	the	section written?	
       2) **Who** wrote	it?
       3) To	 **whom** was	this	written?	
          a) It	is	important	to	 **distinguish** to	whom	the	author	wrote.	






b) Was	the	author	addressing	a church ,	Israel,	Old	Testament	saints,	Gentiles,	
believers,	or	unbelievers?	Making	this	distinction	may	save	you	from	misapplying	
scripture.
c) For	example,	if	something	was	 written to	Abraham	it	is	probably	not	legitimate	
to	apply	it	directly	to	ourselves. God	has	not	promised	to	make	you	or	me	into	a	
great	nation.	Genesis	12:1- 3	
4) And	lastly,	ask	yourself	 why the	author	wrote	what	he	wrote. As	you	read,	you	will	
find	that	many	times	the	author	himself	states	the	purpose	of	writing.
c. The	above	 questions ought	to be	answered	by careful observation.	You	should	not	rely	
on	commentaries	for	the	answers	to	these questions.

2. The	second	step	in	understanding	a	passage	is	 **interpretation** .	What	does	the	text	mean?


a. Always	remember	that	a literal interpretation	of	scripture	is	key	to	understanding	God’s	
Word.
b. You	should	interpret	the	meaning	of	scripture	in	the	 same way	you	understand	every	
other	form	of	communication,	naturally	as	it	reads.
c. Generally,	if	Christians	would	interpret	the	Bible	the	way	everyday	 conversations are	
understood,	the	Bible	would	not	be	so	difficult	to	interpret.
d. When	interpreting	eschatological	passages,	 expect them	to	be	fulfilled	literally. All Old	
Testament	prophecies concerning	Christ’s	First	Advent	were fulfilled	literally.	Isaiah	
7:14,	Matthew	1:22- 25 ,	Jude	1:14- 15	
e. This	fact	is	key	to	interpreting	other	yet-to-be-fulfilled	prophecies. Since	God	fulfilled	
past	prophecies	 exactly as	predicted,	you	can	be	sure	He	will	fulfill	every	yet	unfulfilled	
prophecy literally.
1) An	 example of	prophetic	accuracy	pertinent	to	our	study	is	found	in	Daniel	6:28.	
2) In	Isaiah	44:28	and	45:1,	nearly	150	years	before	King	Cyrus	of	Persia	was	even	
thought	of,	the	prophet	Isaiah	predicted	precisely,	by	 name ,	the	coming	reign	of	
King	Cyrus	and	his	gracious	dealings	with	Israel.
3) You	can	also	see	this	by	 comparing Genesis	15:14	with	its	literal	fulfillment	in	
Exodus	12:33-41.
f. As	already	mentioned,	 context is	king.
1) A	verse	or	passage	can	be	made	to	say	virtually	anything	if	quoted	in	 isolation .	The	
passage	needs	to	be	understood	within	its	immediate	context	as	well	as	within	the	
context	of	the	biblical	book	in	which	it	is	located.	2	Peter	3:
2) As	has	been	noted,	every	verse	is	in	a	 chapter ,	every	chapter	is	in	a	book,	and	every	
book	is	in	a	testament	and	the	testaments	are	in	the	Bible.
3) A	difficult	passage	can	often	become	understandable,	by	 comparing it	to	other	
clear	Bible	passages	that	teach	on	the	same	subject.






4) If	other	clear	passages	on	the	same	subject	contradict	your	ideas	on	the	
interpretation	of	the	passage,	then	your	interpretation	is	 incorrect.

g. When	you	interpret	individual	 **words** ,	keep	in	mind	the	following	principles:


1) Remember	that	 words and	phrases	were	carefully	 chosen by	God	the	Holy	Spirit	
when	He	inspired	each	human	writer.
2) Words	should	not	be	given	an	 isolated definition;	rather,	they	should	be defined	
within	their	immediate	context.
3) When	you consult	a	lexicon	or	dictionary,	you	should be	careful to	not	 hastily apply	
a	general	lexical	definition	to	the word in	question.

h. **Figurative** speech	in	prophetic	passages	will	be	a	challenge.


1) A	word	of	caution	is	important.	The	fact	that	the	Bible	uses	symbols	in	many	
prophetic	passages	does	not	mean	every	Bible	prophecy	has	a	symbolic	or	 mystical
meaning.
2) Often	times	in	prophetic	passages, figurative	expressions are	defined	in	a	 nearby
passage	or	in	another	prophetic	book.
a) An	example	of	this	is	found	in	the	first	chapter	of	Revelation.	In	the	vision	in	
Revelation	1:12	we	encounter	the	symbol	of	 lampstands .	Reading	on,	we	learn	in	
verse	twenty	that	the	 lampstands represent churches.
b) You’ll	need	to	do	your	 homework.
c) Interestingly,	many	symbols	found	in	the	book	of	Revelation	were	 first
introduced	in	the	Old	Testament	by	prophets	like	Ezekiel,	Daniel	or Zechariah.
3) The	Bible	provides	the	interpretation	of	every	 essential symbol	it	uses.	As	a	student	
of	the	Word,	it	is	your	job	to	define	symbolic	descriptions	by	examining	related	
passages	which more	clearly	define	the	symbol rather	than	jumping	to	conclusions	
or	making	suppositions.
4) If	the	metaphor	or	symbol	is	not	defined	in	the	immediate	passage	or	in	another	
biblical	passage,	you	can	 conclude that	the	author intended	for	his	readers	to	
understand	its	meaning	as	it	would	have	been	 normally understood	at	the	time	of	
writing.	
a) An	example	of	a	metaphor can	be	seen	in	Luke	13:32.	Jesus	used	the	 fox as	a	
metaphor	for	describing	King	Herod.	 He	said	to	them,	" Go	and	tell	that	fox ,	
‘Behold,	I	cast	out	demons	and	perform	cures	today	and	tomorrow,	and	the	third	
day	I	reach	My	goal .’
(i) Jesus	used	the	phrase	“ that	fox ”	to	refer	to	Herod	as	a	cruel	and	cunning
enemy of	God’s	people.
(ii) In	today’s	English	language,	 fox could	also	refer	to	a	sexually	attractive	
woman .	It	would	be	wrong	to	read	modern	meaning	back	into	a	text	like	
Luke	13:32.






b) A	figure	of	speech	commonly	used	today	is, “It	is	raining	cats	and	dogs.”
(i) It	is	generally	understood	that	this	means	rain	is	coming	down	with	great	
force .	No	one	thinks	dogs	and	cats	are	literally	falling	from	the	sky.
(ii) We	would	not	look	for	a	 hidden meaning,	or	assign	some	metaphoric	
meaning,	to	the	statement	“It	is	raining	outside.”

i. What	are	some	reasons	for	confusion	when	it	comes	to	interpreting	Bible	passages,	
especially	biblical	prophecy?
1) Many	times	confusion	is	due	to	the	use	of	unfamiliar	or	technical	theological	 **terms** .	
Hopefully	we	can	clarify	these	terms	as	we	proceed	in	our	study	of	Daniel.
2) Other	times	 **confusion** may	have	to	do	with	the	method	of	study	being	used.
3) If	you	have	ever	studied	the	Bible,	you	have	used	some	sort	of	Bible	study	 **method** ,	
even	though	you	may	not	be	aware	of	it.
a) There	are	 **formal** methods	taught	in Bible	study	methods	courses.
b) There	are	also informal	methods	we	apply	by	 **default**. These	can	be	risky.
c) There	are	reliable	and	sound	methods	for	interpreting	Bible	prophecy	and	there	
are	 **flawed** and	erroneous	methods	for	studying	Bible	prophecy.
d) As	outlined	above,	in	this	 **curriculum** we	seek	to	use	a	literal,	historic	and	
grammatical	approach	when	we	interpret	all	Bible	passages.
e) To	be	sure,	it	is	dangerous	to	be	 **sloppy** ,	mystical,	or	even	purely	academic	in	
your	approach	to	Bible study.
4) You	should	avoid	studying	Bible	prophecy	with	the	idea of	learning	some new	or
**unique** truth	no	one	has	ever	discovered before.
a) This	is a **dangerous** supposition	and	has	even	resulted	in	the	creation	of	cults.	1	
Timothy	1:3-7,	2	Timothy	2:14- 18	
b) While	the	ministry	of	the	Holy	Spirit	is	to	illuminate	the	truth,	God	does	not	give	
any	one	person	a	corner	on	the	truth.	We	need	to	be	humble	and	remember	
that	in	the	Church	Age God	has	given	gifted	 **teachers** for	our	edification	and	
learning.	Ephesians	4:1 1 - 16	
c) And	remember,	an	interpretation	should	fit within	the	scope	of	Christian	
**orthodoxy** .	2	Timothy	2:
d) You should	not	study scripture	from	a	mystical	stance.	On	the	contrary,	you	
should	be	 **alarmed** if	you	are	arriving	at	novel interpretations.	
e) Peter	warned	against	individual	or	 **private** interpretations	when	he	cautioned	his	
readers,	“ _But	know	this	first	of	all,	that	no	_ **_prophecy	of	Scripture_** _is	a	matter	of	_
**_one’s	own	interpretation_** _,	for	no	_ **_prophecy_** _was	ever	made	by	an	act	of	human	
will,	but	men	moved	by	the	Holy	Spirit	spoke	from	God.”_ 2	Peter	1:20- 21	






f) Peter	likewise	warned,	“ [Paul]	writes	the	same	way	in	all	his	letters,	speaking	in	
them	of	these	matters.	His	letters	contain	some	things	that	are	hard	to	
understand,	which	ignorant	and	unstable	people	 distort ,	as	they	do	the	other	
Scriptures,	to	their	own	destruction .”	2	Peter	3:14- 17	

3. Your	final	task	is	 **application** :	What	does	the	text	say	to	me?	This	should	only	be	done	after	
    careful	observation	and	interpretation	has	been	completed.

**E. Why	study	the	book	of	Daniel?**

1. Daniel	is	a	unique	book	full	of	both	 **fulfilled** and	unfulfilled	prophecies.
2. The	book	of	Daniel	gives	a	 **panorama** of	history	from	the	time	of	Daniel	(605	BC)	until	the	
    end	of	the	rule	of	humankind.	Daniel	details	Israel’s	future	as well	as the	demise	of	the	
    kingdom or	rule	of	fallen	man.
3. Daniel	is	 **essential** to	unlocking	Biblical	prophecy	and	is	an	important	key	to	exposing	many	
    other	Old	and	New	Testament	prophecies	concerning	the	end	times.
4. Daniel	is	one	of	the	three most important prophetic	 **passages** in	scripture.	These	passages	
    include	the	book	of	Daniel,	the	Olivet	Discourse	(Matthew	24-25)	and	the	book	of	
    Revelation.
5. Understanding	the	book	of	Daniel	will	give	you	courage	because	it	answers	some	relevant	
    **questions** :	When	my	world	falls	apart,	where	is	God?	What	is	God	ultimately	up	to	in	this	
    world?	Does	God	truly	care	about	me	personally?	Is	God	capable	of	helping	me	in	my	trials?	
    A study	of	the	book	of	Daniel will	build	your	faith.
6. Daniel	is	a	narrative	history	with	prophecies	that	are	apocalyptic	or	 **revelatory**.
    a. The	book	of	Daniel	reveals	God’s	 **plans** for	Israel	and	the	nations.
    b. Daniel	is	 **quoted** and	alluded	to	in	the	New	Testament	more	than	any	other	Old	
       Testament	book.
    c. Daniel	has	 **more** fulfilled	prophecies	that	any	other	book	in	the	Bible.
    d. Daniel	is	the	 **key** book	to	unlocking	and	interpreting	prophecy.		





**II. Introduction	to	the	Book	of	Daniel**

**A. Daniel,	the	Man**

1. Daniel’s	name	means	 **God** is	Judge, or	God	is	my	Judge.
2. Daniel	was	a	descendent	of	 **nobility** from	the	tribe	of	Judah.	He	was	intelligent,	fine-looking	
    and	humble.	While	exiled	in	Babylon,	Daniel	developed	into	a	good	administrator	and	
    leader.	Daniel	1:3-4, 6;	2:49, 10:
3. Even	while	suffering	great	pressures	to	conform	to	the	dictates	of	the	pagan	culture	
    surrounding	him,	Daniel	stood	 **strong** with	uncompromised	integrity.	Daniel	6:
4. Daniel	endured	Israel’s	entire	70-year Babylonian	captivity	without	abandoning	the	truth	of	
    God's	 **word**.
    a. Not	only	did	Daniel	endure	the	years	of	exile,	during	this	difficult	time,	he	 **excelled** as	a	
       political	and	spiritual	leader.
    b. It	was	 **God** who	miraculously	installed	him	as	a	ruler	in	Babylon and	raised	him	to	very	
       high	positions	in	government.	
5. God	 **chose** Daniel	to	receive	special	revelation,	and	as	God’s	prophet, his	words	were	
    recorded	in	the	book	of	Daniel.

**B. Modern	skeptics	attack the	veracity	of	the	book	of	Daniel**

1. Daniel	finished	writing	the	book	bearing	his	name	in	about	536	BC, during	the	reign	of	King	
    **Cyrus** the	Persian	(and	King	Darius	the	Mede	who	ruled	the	Chaldeans).
2. Modern	skeptics	 **attack** both	the	authorship	and	date	of	this	book	because	Daniel	predicted	
    future	geopolitical	events	with	astonishing	accuracy	hundreds	of	years	before	they	
    happened.	Since	this seems	like	an	impossibility	to	those	who	do	not	believe	in	the	God	of	
    the	Bible,	they	claim	Daniel	could	not	have	written	the	book.
3. The	eight	manuscripts	of	Daniel that	survived	as	part	of	the	Dead	Sea	Scrolls	in	the	caves	of	
    Qumran	help **verify** Daniel’s	testimony	and	prove	that	the	book	was	not	written	nor	edited	
    after	the	events	occurred.
4. The	fact	that	the	Septuagint	(LXX)	contains	the	book	of	Daniel	confirms	that	Daniel	was	
    written	well	 **before** its	translation	between	the	years	285-247	BC.
5. The	references	to	 **Daniel** in	Ezekiel	serve	as	proof	that	Daniel	lived	and	wrote	his	book	near
    Ezekiel’s	lifetime	during	the	sixth-century BC.	Ezekiel	14:14,	28:
6. Christ’s	testimony	also	supports	the	traditional	 **view** that	Daniel	was	the	author	of	the	book	
    of	Daniel	and	that	it	was	truly	written	in	the	sixth	century	BC.
    a. Jesus	said	in	Matthew	24:15,	“ _Therefore,	when	you	see	the	ABOMINATION	OF	_
       _DESOLATION	which	was	spoken	of	through	_ **_Daniel_** _the	prophet,	standing	in	the	holy	_
       _place	(let	the	reader	understand_ .)”
       1) Christ	referred	to	Daniel	as	a	 **real** ,	historical	person.






2) Christ	clearly	communicated	that	the	prophecies	in	the	book of	Daniel	came	from	
Daniel	and	not	from	some	later	 unknown person.
3) To	deny	either	Daniel	as	the	author, or	the	sixth	century	date of	the	book	of	Daniel,	
is	to	 deny the	trustworthiness	and	accuracy	of	Jesus	Christ.	If	Christ	was	wrong	
about	Daniel,	He	would	not be	sinless	and	therefore	would	not	qualify	as	Savior.
4) Christ	treated	the	Daniel 7	passage	as	a	legitimate prophecy,	verifying	that	Daniel	7	
referred	to	Him	and	His	Second	Coming.	In	Matthew	26:62-68	Christ	 quoted Daniel	
7:13	in	reference	to	Himself.

**C. The	structure	of	the	book	of	Daniel**

1. The	book	contains	accurate	 **history** from Daniel’s	day	and precise	prophetic	predictions,	
    many	of	which	have	already	been	fulfilled	with precision,	as	we	have	noted.
2. The	way	the	book	is	laid	out	shows	it	was	 **written** in	Daniel’s	day.
    a. Similar	to	the	book	of	Judges,	the	organization	of	the	book	of	Daniel	is	 **thematic** rather	
       than	strictly	chronological.
    b. The	book’s	contents	fall	into	two thematic	 **sections**.
       1) Daniel	1- 6	 - Daniel's	 **historical** record	(events	during	his	lifetime)
       2) Daniel	7- 12	 - Daniel's	 **predictive** record	(events to	happen in	the	future)
3. Daniel	can	also	be	organized	according	to	 **language**.
    a. Daniel 1:1	to	2:3	and	chapters	8- 12	 are	written	in **Hebrew**.
       1) Hebrew	was the	language	of	Daniel's	people, **Israel**.
       2) The	sections	written	in	Hebrew	were	directed primarily	to	Israel	and	include	
          prophecies	concerning	Israel’s	 **future**.
    b. Chapters	2:4	through	chapter	7 are	written in	 **Aramaic** ,	the	everyday	language	of	the	
       Gentile world	during	Daniel’s	lifetime.
       1) The	sections	written	in	Aramaic	pertained	primarily	to	 **Gentile** kingdoms.
       2) God	prophesied	in	Aramaic	concerning	His	impending	judgment of	the	kingdom	of	
          fallen	 **humanity** on	earth.	This	is	significant	since	fallen	humanity	needs	to	know	its	
          license	to	rule will one	day expire.

**D. The	theme	of	the	book	of	Daniel	**

1. The	main **theme** of	the	book	of	Daniel	is	that	God	controls	human	history.	Daniel	1:
    a. As	absolute	 **ruler** of	the	universe,	God	gives the	right	to	rule	to	whomever	He	chooses.	
       Daniel	4:17b
    b. Our	omniscient	Creator,	God	 **knows** the	future	and	has	given	us	accurate	information	
       about	it.	Isaiah	46:9-10,	Daniel	12:






c. God	achieves	His	purposes	in	history	even	when	human	rulers	 act rebelliously.	Compare	
Daniel	4:34-35	to	Daniel	5:22-24.
d. God’s	control	of	history	involves	more	struggles	than	can	be	seen	with	human	eyes.	
From	Daniel’s	writings,	we	identify that	nations	and	their	kings have	 demonic
counterparts	that	fight God’s	plans.	Of	course,	they	do	not	succeed	against	God.	Daniel	
10:13,	20- 21 ;	Ephesians	6:
e. God’s	control	of	human	history	includes	the	fulfillment	of	every promise He	has	made.	
1) Israel’s	future,	as	foretold	to	Daniel,	conforms	to God’s	unconditional	 covenant
with	Abraham	and	his	descendants, passed	down	through	Isaac	and	Jacob.	Genesis	
12:1- 3	
2) As	a	fulfillment	of	God’s	 promises to	Abraham,	the	earthly	kingdom of	rebellious	
man will	be	brought	to	an	abrupt	end	and	King	Jesus,	the	seed	of	David,	will	rule	
forever.
a) The	 miracles of	Daniel	1-6	show	God’s	sovereignty	at	work	in	the	protection	of
His	chosen	people	Israel.
b) The	prophecies	of	Daniel	7-12	demonstrate	God’s	sovereignty	at	work	against,
and	through, the	pagan	 nations of	the	world.	

2. Another	theme	in	the	book	of	Daniel	is	the	response	of	Daniel	and	his	three	friends.	All	
    three	unfailingly	and	unreservedly	 **trusted** in	God	and	His	word.	
    a. Daniel	teaches	us	to	stand	for	 **truth** and	be	willing	to	suffer	in	a	 **godless** world.
    b. The	book	of	Daniel	teaches	us	that	when	we	 **pray** God	answers.





**III. Daniel	1- 6	 – Introduction	to	Historical	Section	of	the	Book	of	Daniel**


A. Daniel	lived	during	the	fall of	Judah	and	the	subsequent	rise	and	fall	of	the	Neo-
Babylonian	Empire.

1. It	is	likely	Daniel	was	around	15	years	old	when	he	was	taken	 **captive** to	Babylon.
2. In	Babylon,	God	sovereignly	prepared	and	promoted	Daniel	and	his	three	friends	to	
    positions	of	 **authority** .	This	was	part	of	God’s	divine	masterplan	to	protect	the	Israelites	in	
    subsequent	massive	deportations.
    **B. Six	events	in	the	first	six	chapters	of	the	book	testify	to	God’s	faithfulness	even	
    in	times	of	political	upheaval	and	danger**.
1. Chapter	1	– In	605	BC,	Daniel	 **refused** to	eat	King	Nebuchadnezzar’s	Babylonian	food.	This	
established	the	fact	that	he	would	not	compromise.
2. Chapter	2	– In	about	603	BC,	Daniel	interpreted	Nebuchadnezzar’s	 **dream** of	a	great	image	
of	a	man.	This	established	the	fact	that	God	alone	knows	the	future.
3. Chapter	3	– In	approximately	587	BC,	Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego	refused	to	bow	
before	the	Nebuchadnezzar’s	golden	 **image** ,	and	therefore	faced	the	fiery	furnace.	This
established	the	fact	that	it	is	better	to	suffer	death	than	to	submit	to	idolatry.
4. Chapter	4	– Between	571	– 562	BC,	Nebuchadnezzar	was	judged	by	God	for	his	prideful	
**arrogance** .	He	became	like	a	wild	animal	for	seven	years	until	he	learned	to	give	God	the
glory.	This	judgment	established	the	fact	that	God	alone	is	 _the	Most	High	over	all	the	earth_
(Psalm	83:18)	and	He	alone	rules	in	the	kingdom	of	men.
5. Chapter	5	– In	539	BC,	Belshazzar	witnessed	a	hand	writing	on	a	wall.	Daniel	was	able	to	
interpret	the	writing,	and	just	as	he	predicted,	the	Babylonian	empire	fell	that	very	night.	
This	again	established	the	 **veracity** of	God’s	timeline.
6. Chapter	6	– Between	538-534	BC,	Daniel,	under	King	Darius	the	Mede,	broke	a	human	 **law**
which	had	been	established	as	a	trap	to have	him	killed.	As	a	result,	Daniel	was	cast	into	a	
den	of	lions,	but	God	miraculously	saved	him.	This	established	the	fact	that	compromise	is	
not	an	option.	God’s	authority	is	above	any	human	law.	Acts	5:29	





**IV.Daniel	1	– Daniel	Refused	to	Eat	Babylonian Food**

**A. The	geopolitical	context	of	Daniel	chapter	1.**

1. In	609	BC,	Josiah,	Judah’s	last	“good”	king,	was	killed	by	Pharaoh	Neco	(Necho)	of	Egypt	in	
    the	 **battle** of	Megiddo.	Soon	thereafter	Judah	became	a	vassal	state	of	Egypt.	2	Kings	23:29-
    30
2. After	Josiah’s	death,	Jehoahaz	his	son	came	to	power.	Jehoahaz	ruled	Judah	for	three	
    months,	but	then	Neco	took	him	 **captive** to	Egypt,	where	he	remained	until	his	death.
3. That	same	year,	Pharaoh	Neco	replaced	King	Jehoahaz	with	Johoahaz’	oldest	 **son** ,	Eliakim.	
    Pharaoh	Neco	named	Eliakim,	Jehoiakim.
    a. Jehoiakim	was	25	years	old	when	he	became	 **king**.
    b. Jehoiakim	ruled	Judah	11	years,	until	his	 **death** in	BC	597.
    c. Scripture	says	Jehoiakim	did	 **evil** in	the	sight	of	God.	2	Kings	23:30- 37
4. In	605	BC,	Babylon	defeated	Egypt	in	the	 **battle** of	Carchemish.
5. That	same	year	Nebuchadnezzar	and	his	Babylonian	 **forces** invaded	and	subdued	Judah,	
    taking	Daniel	and	his	three	friends	captive	to	Babylon.
    a. 2	Kings	20:12-19	relates	a	prophecy	from	Isaiah	concerning	this	future event.
       1) In	approximately	BC	710,	a	Babylonian	king,	whose	fledgling	empire	was	beginning	
          to	expand,	sent	a	get-well	 **letter** to	King	Hezekiah	by	the	hand	of	emissaries.
       2) When	the	emissaries	arrived,	King	Hezekiah	foolishly	showed	them	all	his	wealth,	as	
          well	as	the	gold	and	treasures	of	the	 **temple**.
       3) This	act	of	pride	led	the	prophet	Isaiah	to	prophecy	to	King	Hezekiah	that	Babylon	
          would	one	day	return	and	seize	many	of	the	temple	treasures	and	even	 **capture** and	
          deport	many	of	Israel’s	royal	descendants.
       4) Sadly,	Hezekiah	 **selfishly** replied	... _to	Isaiah,	“This	message	you	have	given	me	from	_
          _the	LORD	is	good.”	For	the	king	was	thinking,	“At	least	there	will	be	peace	and	_
          _security	during	my	lifetime.”_ 2	Kings	20:19	(NLT)
    b. Just	as	prophesied,	in	BC	605,	Babylon’s	army	came	and	took Jewish	 **nobility** (one	of	
       whom	was	Daniel),	along	with	many	articles	of	gold	and	other	treasures	from	the	
       temple	in	Jerusalem.
6. After	three	years	Jehoiakim	led	Judah	to	 **rebel** against	Babylon.	This	did	not	end	well	for	
    Judah.	2	Kings	23:34-24:
7. In	597	BC,	Nebuchadnezzar	returned	and	Jehoiakim	was	killed.	His	son	Jehoiachin	(Coniah)	
    took	power	and	 **reigned** in	Israel	for	three	months. 2	Kings	24:1- 16
8. On	March	15,	597	BC, Jehoiachin	surrendered	the	city	of	Jerusalem	to	Nebuchadnezzar.	
    King	Jehoiachin,	ten	thousand	prominent	Judean	citizens,	and	the	prophet	 **Ezekiel** ,	were	all	
    taken	captive	to	Babylon.	2	Kings	24:12– 16





9. Next	Babylon	appointed	Zedekiah,	a	son	of	Josiah,	as	a	puppet	king	in	Judah.	Zedekiah	was	
    Judah’s	 **last** king,	ruling	from	 597 - 586	 BC.	2	Kings	24:17-25:
10. On	January	15,	588	BC,	Nebuchadnezzar	laid	 **siege** to	Jerusalem.	On	July	18,	586	BC,	he	
    finally	succeeded	in	capturing	it.	In	rage,	he	burned	everything	and	completely	destroyed	
    the	walls	of	the	city,	houses	and	the	temple.	This	marked	the	end	of	the	nation	of	Judah. 	2	
    Kings 24:19 - 25:
11. Nebuchadnezzar	became	the	greatest	ruler	of	the	Neo-Babylonian	period	and	arguably	one	
    of	the	most	powerful	 **monarchs** of	the	ancient	world.
    a. His	exploits	brought	Babylon	to	the	pinnacle	of	economic	and	political	prosperity	and	he	
       became	very	 **proud** of	his	triumphs.	Daniel	2:38,	4:
    b. However,	almost	immediately	after	the	 **death** of	King	Nebuchadnezzar	in	562	BC,	
       Babylon’s	glory	began	to	fade.
    c. Twenty-three	years	later,	the	Babylonian	Empire	completely	 **collapsed** ,	giving	way	to	
       the	Medo-Persian	Empire.	Daniel	1:1- 2

###### B. Daniel	1:1-2	explained.

1. Daniel	1:1	– _In	the	third	year	of	the	reign	of	Jehoiakim	king	of	Judah,	Nebuchadnezzar	king	_
    _of	Babylon	came	to	Jerusalem	and	besieged	it_ .	God	used	King	Nebuchadnezzar	to	bring	
    **judgment** on	Judah,	the	southern	kingdom	of	Israel,	because	of	her	rebellion	and	idolatry.
    a. It	is	important	to	understand	that	at	the	time	of	the	writing	of	Daniel,	the	dating	
       method	used	by	Israel	to	count	the	years	of	a	king’s	reign	was	different	than	the	
       **method** used	by	the	Babylonians.	Compare	Jeremiah	25:1	(Jewish	counting)	with	Daniel	
       1:1	(Babylonian	counting).
       1) The	Babylonians	considered	the	first	year	a	king	came	to	the	throne	as	a	special	
          year	and	therefore	did	not	count	it	when	recounting	his	reign.	On	the	other	hand,	
          the	Israelite	custom	was	to	go	ahead	and	 **count** the	first	year	of	a	king’s	reign.
       2) Even	though	Nebuchadnezzar	was	 **crowned** king	in	605	BC,	the	Babylonians	did	not	
          begin	counting	the	years	of	his	reign	until	604	BC.	Jeremiah	46:
       3) Critics	of	God's	Word	have	used	this	supposed	conflict	between	Daniel	1:1	and	
          Jeremiah	25:1	and	46:2	to	attack	the	veracity	of	the	book	of	Daniel,	but	the	
          difference	between	the	 **Jewish** and	Babylonian	counting	systems	easily	answers	
          their	criticisms.
       4) Since	Daniel	lived	in	Babylon,	he	used	the	Babylonian	dating	system	to	recount	this	
          historical	 **event**.
    b. God	allowed	Babylon	to	besiege	Jerusalem	because	Israel	 **failed** to	abide	by	her	
       covenant	with	God.
       1) Only	when	we	properly	understand	the	Abrahamic	and	Mosaic	 **covenants** can	we	
          correctly	discern	God’s	dealings	with	Israel.	Genesis	12:1- 3






2) In	the	Abrahamic	covenant,	God	promised	Abraham	and	his	offspring	(Israel)	
protection	from	 total annihilation.	Malachi	3:
3) Nevertheless,	under	the	interim	terms	of	the	Mosaic	covenant,	God	disciplined	
Israel	when	as	a	nation,	they	repeatedly	 disobeyed Him	and	worshipped	false	gods.	
Exodus	19,	Deuteronomy	28:47-50,	Hebrews	10:
a) Under	the	temporary	terms	of	the	Mosaic	covenant	God	was	always	faithful	to	
bless those	who	obeyed	His	commands.	Leviticus	26:1- 13
b) Under	the	temporary	terms	of	the	Mosaic	covenant	God	was	also	faithful	to	
discipline	(curse)	those	who	did	not	 obey Him.	Leviticus	26:14- 39
c) The	terms	and	demands	of	the	Mosaic	covenant	were	 fulfilled by	Christ.	He	also	
paved	the	way	for	the	establishment	of	the	New	Covenant	with	Israel	in	the	
future.	Matthew	5:17,	John	1:17,	Hebrews	7:22,	8:13,	9:
4) In	the	book	of	Leviticus,	Moses	delineated	the	progressive	 stages of	God’s	
discipline.	
a) Stage	1:	The	first	stage	of	God’s	 discipline would	involve	terror,	diseases	and	
defeat	by	their	enemies,	who	would	eat	(destroy)	the	food	the	Israelites	had	
planted.	Leviticus	26:14- 17
b) Stage	2:	Drought	and	 famine would	follow.	Leviticus	26:18- 20
c) Stage	3:	Wild	animals	would	kill	their	 children and	livestock.	Leviticus	26:21- 22
d) Stage	4:	 War would	follow.	God	would	allow	successful	military	conquests	
against	Israel	by	foreign	enemies.	He	would	send	plagues	and	destroy	their	food	
supply.	Leviticus	26:23- 26
e) Stage	5:	Both	the	countryside	and	their	cities	would	become	uninhabited.	
Starvation	would	even	lead	to	 cannibalism for	survival.	Leviticus	26:27- 32
f) Stage	6:	In	the	last	and	most	extreme	stage	of	discipline,	Israel	would	be	exiled	
to	foreign	lands	and	there	they	would	be	 distressed .	Leviticus	26:33- 39
c. God	was	incredibly	patient	with	His	chosen	people.	Over	a	period	of	hundreds	of	years,	
He	sent	many	prophets	to	 warn them	of	coming	judgment,	but	finally,	when	Israel	
refused	to	turn	to	God,	He	allowed	the	nation	to	be	decimated.	Jeremiah	25:1-11,	
36:27- 31

2. Daniel	1:2	– God's	ultimate	ruling	authority	can	be	seen	here	in	this	verse.


a. Daniel	1:2a	– The	Lord	gave	Jehoiakim	king	of	Judah	into	his	hand,	along	with	some	of	
the	vessels	of	the	house	of	God.	 The	title	 Lord indicates	God's	 authority to	give	Israel	to	
the	Babylonians.	Israel	was	not	conquered	because	of	the	military	might	of	Babylon.
b. Daniel	1:2b	– ... and	he	brought	them	to	the	land	of	Shinar... According	to	Genesis	10	and	
11	the	domination	by	sinful	rulers	over	the	masses	began	at	 Shinar in	Babel.	According
to	scripture,	man’s	corrupt	rule	will	face	final	destruction	in	that	same	place.	Genesis	
10:10,	11:2;	Zechariah	5:11;	Revelation	17- 18






1) Babylon	was	the	capital	of	the	Chaldean	 Empire .	Babel	was	an	ancient	name	for	
Babylon.
2) In	scripture,	Babylon	and	Chaldea refer	to	the	 same ethnic	bloc	of	people.
c. Daniel	1:2c	– ... to	the	house	of	his	god,	and	he	brought	the	vessels	into	the	treasury	of	
his	god. Nebuchadnezzar	would	have	learned	of	these	temple	vessels	of	gold	because	of	
King	Hezekiah’s	careless	 pride in	showing	these	treasures	to	the	Babylonians	nearly	100	
years	before.	Isaiah	
1) After	his	victory	over	Israel,	Nebuchadnezzar	brought	Israel’s	temple	vessels	into	
the	temple	of	his	false	god,	Marduk,	to	 gloat about	the	supposed	superiority	of	his	
god	over	Yahweh.
2) Ironically,	through	Daniel	and	his	three	Jewish	companions,	Nebuchadnezzar	would	
eventually	understand	that	 Yahweh ,	the	Creator-God,	was	the	one	who	gave	him	
his	victories.	He	is	the	only one	worthy	of	worship.

**C. Daniel	1:3- 7	 – A	diabolical	plan	behind	a	human	plan:	This	passage	highlights	**

###### some	of	the	tactics	pagan	societies use	to	manipulate	and	solidify	followers.

1. Daniel	1:3a	– _Then	the	king	ordered	Ashpenaz,	the	chief	of	his	officials,	to	bring	in	some	of	_
    _the	sons	of	Israel_ ...	Ashpenaz	was	a	high-ranking	Babylonian	 **official** who	served	King	
    Nebuchadnezzar.
    a. Ashpenaz	was	ordered	to	include	some	Jewish	youths	in	a	special	training	program	
       designed	for	 **service** to	Babylon.
    b. We	should	observe	Nebuchadnezzar’s	personal	interest	in	this	special	training	program	
       of	these	 **youths**.
2. Daniel	1:3b	– _...including	some	of	the	royal	family	and	of	the	nobles..._ Why	did	
    Nebuchadnezzar	choose	these	particular	youths?
    a. Nebuchadnezzar	likely	wanted	to	keep	the	remaining	 **royal** family	in	Judah	from	
       rebelling.	Having	these	kids	as	hostages	might	help	insure	their	country’s	compliance.
    b. Captives	such	as	these	would	become **trophies** - a	constant	and	pleasant	reminder	of	
       Babylon’s	victories,	a	human	display	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	exploits.
    c. As	sons	of	nobility,	the	empire	would	benefit	from	their	young	minds	and	 **intelligence**.
    d. These	young	people	would	be	ideal	for	interpretation	and	 **translation** of	their	mother	
       tongues.	This	skill	could	greatly	benefit	the	empire,	especially	in	the	“Jewish	affairs”	
       department.
3. Daniel	1:4	– Besides	coming	from	nobility,	these	individuals	had	to	meet	several	 **criteria** in	
    order	to	be	trained	for	King	Nebuchadnezzar.
    a. Daniel	1:4a	– _Youths_ ...	They	had	to	be	 **young** and	impressionable.	They	were	likely	
       between	ages	12	and	16.






b. Daniel	1:4b	– ... in	whom	was	no	defect,	who	were	good-looking ...	They	had	to	be	
handsome	and	without	defect.	As	was	true	of	the	Greek	people,	the	Babylonians	
focused	on	the	handsome	and	 good - looking.
c. Daniel	1:4c	– ... showing	intelligence	in	every branch	of wisdom,	endowed	with	
understanding	and	discerning	knowledge ...	By	using	three	terms	for	intelligence	
(wisdom,	understanding	and	knowledge),	Nebuchadnezzar	emphasized	the	importance	
he	placed	on	intellectual	 aptitude .	This	focus	is	typical	of	the	world.
d. Daniel	1:4d	– ... and	who	had	ability	for	serving	in	the	king’s	court ...	They	had	to	be	of	
teachable	quality	and	 trustworthy .	This	statement	likely	included	the	desire	to	influence	
them	to	accept	Babylonian	ideals,	religion	and	culture.

4. Daniel	1:4	– _and he	ordered	him	to	teach	them	the	literature	and	language	of	the	Chaldean_ .	
    Besides	Chaldean	literature	and	language	(Aramaic),	their	curriculum	likely	included	
    mathematics,	history,	mythology,	agriculture,	architecture,	and	governance.	This	also	likely	
    included	religious	teaching,	such	as	astrology	and	sorcery	( **magic** ).
5. Daniel	1:5a	– _The	king	appointed	for	them	a	daily	ration	from	the	king’s	choice	food	and	_
    _from	the	wine	which	he	drank...	_ The	king’s	choice	foods	not	only	included	unclean	animals,	
    but	most	likely	foods	sacrificed	to	 **idols**.
6. Daniel	1:5b	– Their	training	was	very	 **intentional** .	... _and	appointed	that	they	should	be	_
    _educated	three	years,	at	the	end	of	which	they	were	to	enter	the	king’s	personal	service_ .	The	
    purpose	of	the	king’s	three-year	curriculum	was	to	fully	prepare	these	young	men	for	royal	
    service.
7. Daniel	1:6	– _Now	among	them	from	the	sons	of	Judah	were	Daniel,	Hananiah,	Mishael	and	_
    _Azariah_ .	As	we	progress,	we	will	see	that	these	young	men	were	well-trained	in	 **scripture** .	
    The	parents	of	these	young	men	cared	enough	to	give	them	names	full	of	meaning.	Their	
    names	were	a	reminder	of	Yahweh’s	attributes.	Deuteronomy	6:7,	11:19;	Judges	24:15
    a. The	name	Daniel’s	parents	chose	for	him	meant	“my	 **judge** is	God.”	Daniel’s	parents	
       may	have	foreseen	God’s	imminent	judgment	of	the	idolatry	of the	southern	kingdom	of	
       Judah.
    b. Hananiah’s	Hebrew	name	meant	“Yahweh	is	gracious.”	His	parents	chose	a	name	that	
       would	be	a	constant	reminder	of	their	Creator’s	 **grace**.
    c. Mishael’s	Hebrew	name	meant	“who	is	what	God	is.”	This	name	was	a	reminder	of	the	
       **distinction** between	the	Creator	and	the	creature.	This	name	would	have	been	a	
       reminder	of	their	God's	absolutely	unique	character	and	nature.
    d. Azariah’s	Hebrew	name	meant	“Yahweh	helps.”	This	name	would	have	been	a	reminder	
       that	God	is	the	one	and	only	true	 **helper**.
8. Daniel	1:7	– _Then	the	commander	of	the	officials	assigned	new	names	to	them...	_ The	
    official’s	first	undertaking	was	to	 **rename** these	Jewish	youths	with	Babylonian	names.	This	
    may	have	been	a	maneuver	to	reprogram	their	thinking.	Ultimately,	we	can	see	that	their	
    pagan	names	were	blasphemous.





a. The	purpose	for	changing	their	 **names** may	have	been	to	erase	ethnic	uniqueness	and	to	
also	identify	them	with	the	Babylonian	religious	and	cultural	system.	Their	new	names	
were	connected	to	gods	in	the	Babylonian	pantheon	and	would	remove	their	
attachment	to	the	God	of	Israel.
1) ... _and	to	Daniel	he	assigned	the	name	Belteshazzar_ ...	Daniel's	name	was	changed	to
Belteshazzar,	meaning	“May	Bel	protect	his	life.”	Bel	was	a	 **false** god.
2) ... _to	Hananiah	Shadrach_ ...	Hananiah’s	name	was	changed	to	Shadrach,	meaning	
“command	of	Marduk.”	Marduk	was	the	 **chief** god	of	the	Chaldeans.
3) ... _to	Mishael	Meshach_ ...	Mishael’s	name	was	changed	to	Meshach,	meaning	“Aku	is	
salvation”	or	“who	is	what	Aku	is.”	Aku	was	the	 **moon** god.
4) ... _and	to	Azariah	Abed-nego_ ...	Azariah’s	name	was	changed	to	Abed-nego,	meaning	
“servant	of	Nebo.”	 **Nebo** was	the	son	of	the	false	god	called	Bel	(Baal,	Marduk).

b. In	verse	4	these	youths	were	chosen	to	learn	the	Chaldean	 **language**.

c. In	verse	5	they	were	given	 **food** provisions	that	were	contrary	to	God’s	instructions	for	
the	Israelites.

d. All	three	of	these	undertakings	– the	changing	of	their	names,	language,	and	food	–
would	have	contributed	to	their	enculturation	and	indoctrination	into	the	pagan	
Babylonian	 **worldview**.
1) Having	their	names	changed	to	Babylonian	names,	eating	a	Babylonian	diet	and	
speaking	the	language	of	the	Babylonians,	would	all	have	been	a	process	to	
undermine	national,	family,	and	cultural	allegiances	and	would	help	unify	these	
youth	in	allegiance	to	 **Babylon**.
2) They	were	being	compelled	to	assimilate	the	corrupt	and	idolatrous	Babylonian	
**culture**.
a) These	 **tactics** would	easily	have	led	to	a	distancing	from	their	childhood	God-
based	education.
b) This	process	was	very	likely	strategic	for	Nebuchadnezzar	but	even	more	so	it	
would	have	been	expedient	for	Satan’s	purposes.	The	devil	always	desires	to	
**capture** the	hearts	and	minds	of	youth.	Mark	5:15,	1	Peter	5:8
c) The	temptation	to	 **conform** and	the	offer	of	living	in	luxury	and	leisure	would	
have	been	tantalizing.
d) Of	the	many	Jewish	youths	taken	into	captivity,	only	the	four	recorded	here	
seemed	to	have	remained	 **strong** and	unyielding in	this	enculturation	process.





###### D. Daniel	1:8- 16	 – Daniel’s	Refusal	to	Compromise

1. The	kingdoms	of	 **mankind** are	built	on	the	 _wisdom	of	the	world_ .	Daniel	4:17;	1	Corinthians	

###### 1:20,	2:6;	Colossians	2:8


a. Since	Satan	is	the	author	of	secular	wisdom,	all	secular	wisdom	is	 similar .	The	wisdom	of	
the	world	always	promotes	antagonism	towards	God	and	arrogant	independence	from	

###### Him.	James	3:14- 15


b. Although	Daniel	and	his	three	friends	were	surrounded	by	the	wisdom and	philosophy	
of	the	world,	they	stood	 firm because	– first	of	all	they	had	been	taught	God’s	word,	
secondly, they	chose	to	believe	God’s	word,	and	thirdly	they	trusted	God	to	take	care	of	

###### them.	Psalm	9:10,	Ephesians	6:10,	13-17;	Romans	12:2;	Hebrews	11:33


c. As	Daniel, boldly	trusted	God	to	do	the	right	thing,	God	gave	him	 true ,	godly	wisdom	
and	discernment.	His	three	friends	followed	his	example.	Philippians	1:9;	1	Corinthians	

###### 1:20,	2:6;	James	1:5- 8


d. In	order	to	better	understand	the	 gravity of	Daniel’s	decision,	it	would	be	helpful	to	

###### ponder	the	circumstances	in	which	Daniel	found	himself.


1) Daniel’s	home	nation	Israel	had	recently	suffered	as	a	tributary	state	to	Egypt	

###### (political	slavery)	and	was	now	becoming	a	 tributary state	to	Babylon.


2) Thousands	of	Daniel’s	people	had	 died in	war	and	thousands	more	were	being	

###### mistreated.


3) Basic	necessities	were	likely	getting	scarcer	in	Israel	as	Babylon	 decimated their	

###### country.	


4) Families	had	been	 divided and	the	best	and	brightest	minds	of	Israel	were	carted	

###### away	to	Babylon.

###### 5) Daniel’s	world	had	recently	fallen	apart	with	his	own	 deportation to	Babylon.

###### 6) Going	against	the	king’s	 orders under	such	circumstances	was	no	small	decision!

2. Daniel	1:8	– _But	Daniel	made	up	his	mind	that	he	would	not	defile	himself	with	the	king’s	_
    _choice	food	or	with	the	wine	which	he	drank;	so, he	sought	permission	from	the	commander	_

###### of	the	officials	that	he	might	not	 defile himself.


a. Daniel	made	the	conscious	decision	not	to	eat	the	king’s	recommended	dietary	regimen,	
even	though	it	would	have	been	considered	the	 best food	available	at	that	time.	... the	

###### king’s	choice	food ...

###### b. The	text	shows	that	Daniel	was	concerned	with	defilement.


1) Twice	in	this	verse	Daniel	used	the	Hebrew	word	 defile GA’AL,	which	can	refer	to	

###### ceremonial	or	 moral defilement.


2) Daniel	was	not	acting	in	pride	when	he	refused	the	king’s	diet;	rather,	he	was	

###### making	an	effort	to	not	defile	his	 conscience by	going	against	God’s	law.






3) Exodus	34:15	– ... otherwise	you	might	make	a	covenant	with	the	inhabitants	of	the	
land	and	they	would	play	the	harlot	with	their	gods	and	sacrifice	to	their	gods,	and	

###### someone	might	invite	you	to	 eat of	his	sacrifice .	Numbers	25:1- 2


4) Daniel’s	decision	to	honor	God’s	word	over	man’s	decrees	led	him	to	 petition the	
commander	of	the	officials	to	allow	him	to	refrain	from	eating	foods	that	would	

###### defile	him.	Jeremiah	11:1-3,	Acts	5:29


c. Why	did	Daniel	choose	to	take	a	stand	against	the	pagan	diet	and	not	take	a	stand

###### against	his	pagan	name	or	the	pagan	 education he	was	being	given?


1) Contrary	to	the	conduct	of	the	majority	of	Israel’s	kings	and	populace,	Daniel	sought	
to	keep	the	Mosaic	 Law with	it’s	the	dietary	restrictions.	Leviticus	11,	Deuteronomy	

###### 14:3- 20


2) Daniel	understood	that	eating	the	meat	and	drinking	the	wine	would	be	considered	
worship of	false	gods,	and	that	would	defile	his	conscience.	Romans	14:2,	13-23;	1	

###### Corinthians	8:7-10,	13;	10:25- 28

3. Daniel	1:9	– _Now	God	granted	Daniel	favor and	compassion	in	the	sight	of	the	commander	_
    _of	the	officials_ ...	When	Daniel	made	the	choice	to	follow	the	authority	of	God’s	word,	God	
    honored	his	decision.	Although	the	commander	did	not	immediately	allow	him	to	change	

###### his	diet,	he	showed	 compassion to	Daniel.	1	Peter	5:5- 6

4. Daniel	1:10	– The	commander	voiced	his	concerns	about	allowing	Daniel	to	deviate	from	
    the	king’s	dietary	regimen.	He	was	more	 **afraid** for	himself	than	he	was	concerned	for	

###### Daniel’s	health.

5. Daniel	1:11- 14	 – Instead	of	being	discouraged	by the	officer’s	reluctance,	Daniel	came	back	

###### with	a	 proposal to	do	a	ten-day	test	run.	This	was	something	the	official	could	accept.

###### a. Daniel’s	proposal	showed	 trust in	God	to	control	the	results.


b. It	is	important	to	note	that	Daniel	did	not	yell	and	scream	or demand his	rights.	He	
approached	the	government	official	with	calm	wisdom.	This	is	a	good	example	for	us	as	

###### believers	to	follow	even	today.

###### c. The	plan	was	approved	and	the	 experiment was	conducted.


d. We	need	to	understand	that	the	Babylonian	concept	of	vegetables	included	anything	

###### grown	from	the	ground,	including	vitamin	and	 protein laden	grains,	nuts	and	legumes.

6. Daniel	1:15- 16	 – In	only	ten	days,	these	young	men	looked	remarkably	better	than	those	
    eating	the	king’s	food.	Therefore,	the	four	Hebrew	youths	were	allowed	to	 **continue** on	this	

###### diet.

###### a. This	was	due	to	 divine intervention	more	than	to	the	fact	that	it	was	a	good	diet.


b. This	victory	would	have	strengthened	the	young	men’s	faith,	giving	them	much	needed	
confidence	when	faced	with	greater	temptations	to	compromise	in	the	 future.






c. This	visible	victory	would	also	have	calmed	everyone’s	hearts	so	they	could	live	in	 peace
with	their	adversaries	without	the	inclination	to	compromising	God’s	standards.	Romans	

###### 12:18

##### E. Daniel	1:17- 21	 – Graduation	and	Promotion

1. Daniel	1:17	– _As	for	these	four	youths,	God	gave	them	knowledge	and	intelligence	in	every	_
    _branch	of	literature	and	wisdom;	Daniel	even	understood	all	kinds	of	visions	and	dreams._
    God’s	provision	of	magnificent	blessings	shows	how	God	honors	those	who	honor	Him.	This	

##### theme is	repeated	throughout	this	book.


a. God	did	not	simply	give	Daniel	and	his	friends	knowledge;	He	gave	them	the	ability	to	

##### skillfully	use	that	knowledge	for	His	honor	and	 glory .	This	is	called	wisdom.


b. The	Hebrew	word	for	 intelligence SAKAL	means	insight	or	prudence.	Because	of	their	
confidence	in	Him,	God	gave	these	four	Hebrew	youths	the	ability	to	gain	greater	 insight

##### and	understanding	than	those	who	did	not	trust	or	know	God.


c. Literature SEPHER	(book)	as	used	in	this	verse	referred	to	written	compilations	(books)	
that	would	likely	have	included	all	pagan	teachings	on	the	 origins of	the	world,	various	
religious	topics,	incantations,	interpretation	of	omens,	astrology,	and	even	the	study	of	

##### animal	entrails	(liver	and	kidneys)	and	bird	flight	patterns.


d. Wisdom CHOKMAH,	referred	to	using	God's	Word	correctly.	Wisdom,	or	the	correct	use	

##### of	God’s	Word,	was	a	constant	 focus of	Daniel	throughout	his	entire	life.


e. The	fact	that	God	gave	Daniel	the	ability	to	understand	visions	and	dreams	is	proof	

##### Daniel	was	indeed	a	 prophet .	Daniel	2,	4,	5

2. Daniel	1:18- 19	 – The	day	came	when	Nebuchadnezzar	recognized	the	excellence	of	these	
    four young	Jewish	youths	and	made	them	important	aides	in	his	kingdom.	The	use	of	their	

##### Hebrew	 names in	these	verses	emphasizes	their	link	to	God	rather	than	Babylon.


a. It	is	interesting	that	these	four	Hebrew	youths	had	personal	 interviews with	the	great	

##### and	mighty	King	Nebuchadnezzar.	That	is	impressive.


b. The	 outcome of	their	meeting	with	the	king	would	affect	the	rest	of	their	lives,	their	
own	nation’s	future,	the	Babylonian	empire,	and	even	impact	a	lowly	home	in	the	town	

##### of	Bethlehem	some	600	years	later.	Matthew	2:1- 12


c. In	the	sovereignty	of	God,	these	young	men	passed	the	king’s	test	with	flying	colors,	

##### giving	God	four	“secret	 agents ”	in	the	demonically	controlled	Babylonian	empire.

3. Daniel	1:20	– _As	for	every	matter	of	wisdom	and	understanding	about	which	the	king	_
    _consulted	them,	he	found	them	ten	times	better	than	all	the	magicians	and	conjurers	who	_
    _were	in	all	his	realm_ .	Because	these	young	captives	did	not	 **compromise** the	truth,	they	

##### were	able	to	give	King	Nebuchadnezzar	superior sound	advice.

4. Daniel	1:21	– _And	Daniel	continued	until	the	first	year	of	Cyrus	the	king_ .	Daniel’s	career	in	

##### the	 government continued	all	the	way	until	539	BC	when	Cyrus	overthrew	Babylon.





#### F. Reflections	from	Daniel	chapter	1

1. Daniel	and	his	friends	must	have received	a	 **godly** upbringing	from	their	parents,	as	

##### evidenced	by	their	names	and	their	faithfulness	to	God	even	in	captivity.


a. From	the	founding	of	their	nation	God	commanded	believing	Israelites	to	 teach their	

##### children	the	truth.	Deuteronomy	6:6- 9


b. Daniel	was	 young when	he	faced	the	brainwashing	tactics	of	the	Babylonians.	Even	so,	
he	remained	unswervingly	faithful	to	the	Word	of	God.	This	should	encourage	us	as	we	

##### impart	biblical	training	to	our	young	people.

2. Daniel	 **chose** to	distinguish	himself	from	the	pagan	culture	that	encircled	him.	Philippians	

##### 2:14- 16


a. Just	as	Daniel	did	not	choose	to	fight	his	name	change	or	his	education	in	a	pagan	

##### school,	we	need	to	pick	our	battles	carefully.	Let	the	 main issue	be	the	main	issue.


b. We	should	respect	the	government	God	has	given	to	rule	over	us	even	if	our	faith	in	the	

##### Word	of	God	requires	that	we	 tactfully challenge	some	law	or	requirement.	Romans	13


c. We	should	understand	the	worldview	of	those	in	power	and	wisely	anticipate	their	

##### reactions	to	a	request.	This	will	help	us	use	 diplomacy in	devising	godly	challenges.


d. We	should	compare	every	legal	requirement	with	scripture	and	in	this	way, determine	

##### its	 impact and	importance.	2	Corinthians	10:5

##### 3. The	 lives of	Joseph,	Moses,	and	Daniel	were	similar.

##### a. All	three	were	Jews	and	well-trained	in	biblical	 truth as	children.


b. Although	Joseph	and	Daniel	were	prisoners	in	strange	 lands ,	they	were	esteemed	within	

##### those	pagan	cultures.


c. Moses	and	Daniel	were	trained	in	the	 best pagan	educational	systems	of	their	times;	yet	

##### they	chose	to	live	by	God's	Word.	Hebrews	11:24- 26

##### d. God	used	all	three	mightily	to	move	His	 plan forward	for	Israel.


e. Despite	not	having	many	of	the	blessings	we	have	as	Church	Age	believers	(including	the	
filling,	indwelling,	and	gifting	of	the	Holy	Spirit;	the	completed	canon	of	scripture;	our	
personal	priesthood;	and	our	access	to	God	through	Christ),	all	three	of	these	men	dealt	

##### successfully	with	life’s	inevitable	 tests.

4. Could	your	country	become	a	pagan	country	like	Israel	or	Babylon?	Yes.	It	could.	History	
    evidences	that	when	Christians	in	a	nation	cease	to	recognize	the	 **authority** of	God’s	Word,	

##### they	lose	their	influence	on	the	culture.	Philippians	2:15


a. Moral	decay	in	a	nation	typically	starts	with	spiritual lethargy and	compromise	among	

##### believers.


b. Then	God’s	Word	often	becomes	reinterpreted,	 cheapened ,	ignored	or	even	

##### deliberately	abandoned.






c. This	process	gives	way	to	moral	relativity	where	 feelings trump	truth.	A	low	restraint	in	

##### ethics,	sexuality	and	morality	begins	to	prevail.


d. Thereafter	believers	embrace	a	religious	 pluralism concept.	All	truth	claims	are	to	be	
treated	as	equal.	All	gods	and	religions	are	to	be	tolerated	equally	(with	the	exception	of	

##### the	truth	of	God’s	word).

##### e. The	final	result	is	a	totally godless nation	where	Christians	face	persecution.

**V. Daniel	2:1- 49	 – Nebuchadnezzar’s	Unsettling	Dream**

**A. Introduction**

1. Daniel	chapters	two	and	seven	paint	the	most	complete	picture	of	human	history	in	all	of	
    scripture.	This	kind	of	accuracy	in	predicting	the	future	is	not	found	anywhere	else	in	the	
    world.	Prophecy	and	its	 **precise** fulfillment	prove	the	Bible	to	be	the	most	unique	and	
    reliable	source	of	truth	on	earth.
2. Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream	gives	a	comprehensive	overview	of	the	 _times	of	the	Gentiles_ with	
    an	emphasis	on	the	four	 **empires** that	would	dominate	world	history,	relating	primarily	to	
    Israel	until	the	time	Messiah	would	set	up	His	earthly	kingdom.	Luke	21:24
    a. Gentiles	refers	to	all	people	who	are	not	 **Jews**.
    b. God	did	not	concern	Himself	with	predicting	every	world	empire.	He	focused	only	on	
       those	that	would	directly	impact	the	 **nation** of	Israel.
    c. There	are	certain	things	God	wants	us	to	understand	about	the	past,	present	and	future.	
       Understanding	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream	is	 **key** to	understanding	important	biblical	
       teaching	on	future	events.
3. God	used	the	sudden	occasion	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	disturbing	dream	to	establish	Daniel’s	
    reputation	as	a	wise	man	in	Babylon	and	to	place	him	strategically	in	a	high	 **position** in	the	
    government.
4. We	should	note	that	after	Daniel	2:3,	Daniel	switched	to	write	in	 **Aramaic** ,	the	language	of	
    the	Babylonians,	and	continued	to write	in	Aramaic	until	chapter	7:28.	This	is	significant.
    a. This	Aramaic	section	of	Daniel	foretells	 _the	times	of	the	Gentiles_ ,	a	prolonged	period	of	
       Gentile	 **rule** and	domination	of	Israel,	corroborated	by	Jesus	in	Luke	21:24.
    b. During	the	times	of	the	Gentiles,	four	world	powers	will	dominate	Jerusalem	and	Israel.	
       This	period	will	last	until	God’s	 **kingdom** ,	headquartered	in	Israel,	is	established	on	
       earth.	This	will	become	clear	as	we	advance.
    c. The	times	of	the	Gentiles	started	around	600	BC	and	will	last	all	the	way	until	Christ’s	
       second	coming.	When	Daniel	wrote,	the	times	of	the	Gentiles	were	almost	entirely	
       **future**.





**B. Daniel	2:1- 3	 – In	602	BC,	King	Nebuchadnezzar	had	a	dream.**

1. Daniel	2:1	– _Now	in	the	second	year	of	the	reign	of	Nebuchadnezzar,	Nebuchadnezzar	had	_
    _dreams;	and	his	spirit	was	troubled	and	his	sleep	left	him_ .	Since	the	Babylonians	believed	
    dreams	were	messages	from	the	 **gods** ,	Nebuchadnezzar	was	very	desirous	to	know	what	
    the	dream	meant.
    a. This	dream	was	actually	a	recurring	dream	that	came	from	the	one	 **true** God.	God	gave	
       Nebuchadnezzar	a	message	that,	among	other	things,	predicted	the	eventual	end	of	his	
       kingdom.	Daniel	2:29
    b. The	phrase	 _and	his	spirit	was	troubled_ PAAM	is	grammatically	an	intensive	imperfect	
       action	communicating	that	this	recurring	dream	was	 **tormenting** Nebuchadnezzar.	He	
       lost	sleep	over	it.
    c. It	is	very	amazing	to	consider	that	God	chose	a	 **pagan** king,	Nebuchadnezzar,	to	receive	
       this	special	revelation,	in	the	form	of	a	repeated	dream.	This	dream	accurately	
       previewed	looming	human	history.	Jeremiah	27:4- 8
       1) God	had	spoken	and	all	Satan’s	henchmen	were	 **helpless** to	understand.	
          Nebuchadnezzar	had	dreamed	the	dream	that	was	impossible	to	interpret.
       2) In	many	ways,	this	was	spiritual	warfare	between	God	and	his	adversaries.	God	had	
          already	won	a	tremendous	victory	in	chapter	one	by	granting	his	four	emissaries	
          freedom	from	defilement.	Chapter	two	will	likewise	be	a	 **victory** for	God.
       3) In	infinite	wisdom,	our	 **sovereign** God	successfully	used,	and	continues	to	use,	
          events	and	even	non-believers	to	reveal	and	advance	His	plans	and	universal	
          agenda.
2. Daniel	2:2	– _Then	the	king	gave	orders	to	call	in	the	magicians,	the	conjurers,	the	sorcerers	_
    _and	the	Chaldeans	to	tell	the	king	his	dreams.	So,	they	came	in	and	stood	before	the	king_ .	
    Nebuchadnezzar	called	in	his	 **elite** staff	of	wise	men	and	demanded	they	explain	his	
    distressing	dream.	Genesis	41:1-8.
    a. The	book	of	Daniel	describes	five	groups	of	“wise	men”	that	practiced	their	crafts	within	
       the	Babylonian	empire.	These	groups	represented	separate	 **occult** societies.	Each	
       wielded	influence	in	his	particular	field.	Daniel	1:20,	2:2,	2:27
       1) Magicians:	These	scholars	were	occult	specialists	and	were	considered	masters	of	
          **literature** .	Daniel	1:20,	2:2
       2) Conjurers	(enchanters):	These	were	individuals	who	used	incantations	and	
          practiced	 **exorcism** .	Daniel	2:27
       3) Sorcerers:	These	individuals	bewitched	people	and	cast	 **spells** .	These	would	be	
          called	witches	and	warlocks	in	today’s	world.	Daniel	2:2
       4) Chaldeans	(astrologers):	This	was	the	elite	cast	of	priests	of	the	ancient	Babylonian	
          religions.	Among	other	practices,	these	individuals	looked	to	the	 **stars** to	discover	
          the	future.	Daniel	2:2






5) Diviners:	This	religious	sect	specialized	in	foretelling	or	decreeing	a	person’s	 fate .	
These	would	be	called	fortunetellers	in	today’s	world.	Daniel	2:27
b. These	were	the	 wise	men Nebuchadnezzar	called	to	explain	his	dream.	They	were	part	
of	the	world	system	and	were	squarely	under	Satan’s	control.	They	were	portrayed	as	
having	much	more	wisdom	than	the	ordinary	citizen.

3. Daniel	2:3	– _The	king	said	to	them,	“I	had	a	dream	and	my	spirit	is	anxious	to	understand	the	_
    _dream.”_ In	spite	of	appealing	to	the	best	minds	the	world	had	to	offer,	Nebuchadnezzar	
    received	no	 **help**.

**C. A	Short	Explanation	of	Dreams	and	Visions**

1. God	used	both	dreams	and	visions	to	communicate	special	revelation	to	His	people,	but	
    that	communication	stopped	when	the	Bible	was	 **completed** .	Daniel	2,	Matthew	1
2. Dreams	and	visions	 **differed** in	 **three** ways.
    a. Dreams	emphasized	what	was	 **seen** .	Visions	emphasized	what	was	said.	Numbers	12:6
    b. Only	believers	had	 **visions** .	A	possible	exception	is	Cornelius,	a	God-lover,	in	Acts	9	- 10.	
       Both	believers	and	unbelievers	received	dreams.	Genesis	37,	40- 41
    c. In	every	dream	in	the	Bible,	the	dreamer	was	passive	and	 **asleep** ;	however,	during	a	
       vision,	the	recipient	was	always	mentally	and	spiritually	alert.
3. God	used	dreams	only	 **occasionally** to	reveal	His	plan;	eventually	He	sent	His Son	Jesus	
    Christ	to	speak	directly	to	mankind.	Hebrews	1:1- 2
    a. There	are	only	twenty-two	dreams	recorded	by	God	the	Holy	Spirit	in	Scripture,	not	a	
       large	number	considering	the	Bible	spans	3,000	years	of	human	history.	We	can	be	sure	
       God	included	every	 **dream** we	need	to	know.
    b. The	 **Old** Testament	records	sixteen dreams.
       1) Eleven	of	these	dreams	occurred	 **before** any	of	the	Old	Testament	was	written.	
          Genesis	20:3,	6;	28:12;	31:10- 1 1,	24;	37:5,	9;	40:5;	41:1,	5;	Judges	7:13;	1	Kings	3:5;	
          Daniel	2:1,	4:5,	7:1
       2) Although	dreams	sometimes	involved	individuals	(Genesis	20:3;	28:12;	31:24;	
          37:5,9;	40:8),	every	dream	was	about	either	the	advancement	of	God’s	greater	 **plan**
          for	Israel	or	about	the	role	of	Gentile	nations	in	the	completion	of	His	plan.	Genesis	
          41:1,	Daniel	2
    c. The	 **New** Testament	recorded	six dreams.	Matthew	1:20,	2:12–13,	19,	22,	27:19
       1) All	six	of	the	New	Testament	dreams	occurred	 **before** the	New	Testament	was	
          completed.
       2) The	last	recorded	dream	was	in	the	book	of	Acts	and	occurred	just	prior	to	the	
          writing	of	Paul’s	first **epistle**.






d. God	used	dreams	as	one	way	to	reveal	truth directly to	a	man	(special	revelation).	
Genesis	37,	40-41;	Hebrews	1:1a	
1) False	prophets	eagerly	told	everyone	their	false	dreams,	but	 true prophets	were	
faithful	to	tell	only	those	words	they	received	directly	from	God.	Jeremiah	23:28-32,	
29:8-9;	Daniel	2:29-30,	47
2) The	correct	interpretation	of	a	dream	came	from the	Lord,	not	from	any	 man .	
Genesis	41:16,	Daniel	2:28,	2	Peter	1:20- 21
e. Today,	God	 communicates to	us	through	the	written	Word of	God.	Colossians	3:16,	
Romans	10:17
1) We	do	not	need	dreams to	reveal	new	knowledge	because	we	have	 all we	need	for	
life	and	godly	living	permanently	recorded	in	God's	Word,	the	Bible.	2	Peter	1:2- 4
2) We	place	ourselves	in	grave	 danger if	we	look	to	dreams for	God’s	answers	or	for	
His	plans	for	our	lives.	Colossians	2:18.
3) God	commands	us	to	look	to	His	 word ,	which	is	His	trustworthy revelation	to	us,	His	
children.	Psalm	1:1-2,	119:105;	Colossians	2:18
f. Studies	show	that	 everyone dreams	while	they	sleep.	Many	factors,	including	the	
following,	influence	our	dreams.
1) Physical factors,	such	as	exhaustion,	a	poor	diet,	chemical	imbalance,	and	drug	
consumption,	can	affect	dreams.	Isaiah	29:7- 8
2) Emotions ,	such	as	worry,	anxiety,	fear,	depression,	joy,	and	euphoria,	can	affect	
dreams.	Ecclesiastes	5:3,	7;	Ephesians	4:26- 27
3) Supernatural (demonic,	satanic) sources can	affect	dreams.	Colossians	2:18,	
Deuteronomy	13:1-2,	Jeremiah	23:25- 32

4. Visions were	God's	special	revelation	given	to	someone	who	was	 **awake** ,	either	at	night	or	
    during	the	day.	Genesis	46:2;	Job	4:13,	20:8,	33:15;	Isaiah	29:7;	Daniel	2:19
    a. A	biblical	vision was	radically	different	from	pagan	 **trances** or	modern	ecstatic	or	
       mystical	experiences.	Daniel	8:1
    b. Often	a	vision	was	like	looking	through	a	 **window** to	watch	a	scene unfold.	Zechariah	
       1:7-10,	Acts	10:11,	Revelation	1:1
    c. During	a	vision,	the	recipient	was	able	to	 **think** logically	and	interact	with	angels	or	God.	
       Zechariah	4:5- 6
    d. If	God	wanted	a	vision	understood,	He	 **revealed** its	interpretation.	He	did	not	allow
       people to	randomly	interpret	a	vision.	2	Peter	1:20- 21
    e. Sometimes,	people	took	 **part** in	a	vision.	For	example,	Cornelius	and	an	angel	interacted	
       in	a	vision	early	in	the	Church	Age	(Acts	10:3).	Jesus	personally	encouraged	Paul	through	
       a	vision	(Acts	18:9).






f. The	apostle	 John received	a	revelation	APOKALYPSIS	while	in	the	spirit	EN	PNUEMATI	
and	recorded	God's	final	words	to	us.	Revelation	1:10- 20
g. The	 Old Testament	recorded	 39	 visions.	Daniel	8:1- 2
h. The	 New Testament	recorded	several	visions,	including	Ananias’	(Acts	9:10,	12),	Peter’s	
(Acts	10:17,	11:5),	John’s	(Revelation	9:17)	and	Paul’s	Macedonian	call (Acts	16:9-10).

5. God’s	Word	gives	us	all	the	special	revelation	we	need;	therefore,	God	no	longer	uses
    dreams	or	visions	to	 **communicate** with	us.	Colossians	2:18
6. Dreams	and	visions	will	 **return** during	the	dark	days	of	the	Tribulation	just	prior to	the	Lord’s	
    return	to	set	up	His	kingdom	(Joel	2:28-32)	and	inaugurate	the	New	Covenant	with	Israel.	
    Jeremiah	31:31-34,	Hebrews	8:8- 12

**D. Daniel	2:4- 13	 – A	gruesome	job	for	a	royal	executioner**

1. Daniel	2:4	– _Then	the	Chaldeans	spoke	to	the	king	in	Aramaic:	“O	king,	live	forever!	Tell	the	_
    _dream	to	your	servants,	and	we	will	declare	the	interpretation.”_
    a. In	verse	four,	Daniel	began	writing	in	 **Aramaic** ,	a	Gentile	language.	This	indicated	a	
       purposeful	shift	in	emphasis	away	from	Israel	to	the	rule	of	man.
    b. The	Chaldeans,	being	scholars,	were	probably	confident	they	could	search	their	books	
       and	explain	the	meaning	behind	the	king’s	dream.	They	spoke	to	him	in	Aramaic,	his	
       native	tongue,	possibly	to	engender	 **confidence** in	their	credibility.
    c. Even	still,	these	men	could	not	interpret	the	dream	without	first	knowing	the	 **details** of	
       the	dream.
2. Daniel	2:5,	8- 9	 – The	king	said,	“ _the	command	from	me	is	firm_ ,”	and	“ _I	know	for	certain	that	_
    _you	are	bargaining	for	time_ .”	He	added,	“ _For	you	have	agreed	together	to	speak	lying	and	_
    _corrupt	words	before	me	until	the	situation	is	_ **_changed_** .”
    a. Nebuchadnezzar	was	part	of	the	same	culture as	his	advisors;	he	knew	their pagan	
       **techniques** for	interpreting	dreams.
    b. Generally,	the	king	would	 **explain** the	dream	first	and	then	books	and	other	resources	
       might be	consulted	to	give	the	interpretation.
    c. Some	interpreters	 **speculate** that	Nebuchadnezzar	had	forgotten	the	dream.	But	if	that	
       were	the	case,	they	could	have	made	up	any	story	and	he	would	never	have known	the	
       difference.
    d. It	may	be	that	the	king	was	beginning	to	 **distrust** his	wise	men.	We	don’t	know.
    e. Whatever	the	case,	the	king	realized	that	if	his	advisors	could	not	see	into	the	past	to	
       know	the	details	of	his	dream,	he	could	not	trust	their	advice	about	the	 **future** either,	
       which	he	believed	the	dream	revealed.
    f. This	was	an	impossible expectation,	but	that	is	exactly	what	God	wanted	in	order	to	
       **advance** Daniel	and	his	three	companions in	the	empire.





3. Daniel	2:6	– “ _But	if	you	declare	the	dream	and	its	interpretation,	you	will	receive	from	me	_
    _gifts	and	a	reward	and	great	honor;	therefore,	declare	to	me	the	dream	and	its	_
    _interpretation_ .”	The	king	promised	great	 **benefits** to	anyone	who	could	successfully	
    interpret	the dream.
4. Daniel	2:7	– _They	answered	a	second	time	and	said,	“Let	the	king	tell	the	dream	to	his	_
    _servants,	and	we	will	declare	the	interpretation.”_ When	King	Nebuchadnezzar	 **declined** to	
    describe	the	dream	for	his	advisors	a second	time,	they	panicked.
    a. This	shows	Satan’s	limitations.	He	does	not	 **know** everything.	
    b. Satan	is	a	 **deceiver** ,	and	therefore	his	cohorts	practice	deceit.	Acts	13:10,	John	8:44
5. Daniel	2:8- 9	 – The	king	recognized	their	 **delay** tactics	and	became	angered	by	their	attempts	
    to	deceive	him.	He	demanded	once	more	that	they	first	disclose his dream to	him.
6. Daniel	2:10- 11	 – The	advisors’	words	confirmed	the	king’s	suspicions	about	their	lack	of	
    competency.	They	themselves	condemned	their	own	pagan	practices	and	confirmed	the	
    **weakness** of	their	religious	system.
    a. This	statement	set	the	stage	for	Daniel	to	be	revered	and	for	His	God	to	be	 **exalted** and	
       proven	to	be	the	only	true	deity.	God	would	do	what	no	other	gods	could	do.
    b. Although	Satan	does	have	influence	and	is	intelligent,	he	was	not	 **able** to	reveal	the	
       dream	or	its	meaning	to	the	wise	men.	Genesis	3:1,	2	Corinthians	2:11,	1	Peter	5:8
    c. Even	though	Satan	rules	in	the	kingdom	of	men	and	even	presided	over	Babylon,	he	did	
       not	 **know** what	was	ultimately	going	on	in	God’s	plan.	God	was	still	in	control.
7. Daniel	2:12	– _Because	of	this	the	king	became	indignant	and	very	furious	and	gave	orders	to	_
    _destroy	all	the	wise	men	of	Babylon_ .	The	king’s	impassioned	anger	moved	him	to	demand	
    the	 **death** of	all	his	advisers,	including	Daniel	and	his	friends.
8. Daniel	12:13	– _So	the	decree	went	forth	that	the	wise	men	should	be	slain;	and	they	looked	_
    _for	Daniel	and	his	friends	to	kill	them_.
    a. God	is	always	in	control.	He	was	going	to	use	this	crisis	to	 **glorify** Himself.	Psalm	76:10
    b. By	shining	His	light	on	the	 **deficiency** of	the	wisdom	of	the	world,	God	was	preparing	
       King	Nebuchadnezzar	to	believe	in	Him.	Daniel	4;	Romans	9:22-23,	11:33- 36

**E. Daniel	2:14- 18	 – Daniel	was	calm in	the	crisis**

1. Daniel	2:14	– _Then	Daniel	replied	with	discretion	and	discernment	to	Arioch,	the	captain	of	_
    _the	king’s	bodyguard,	who	had	gone	forth	to	slay	the	wise	men	of	Babylon_ .	This	man	Arioch,	
    one	of	the	king’s	bodyguards,	was	commanded	to	function	as	an	 **executioner**.
    a. Without	panicking,	Daniel	wisely spoke	to	Arioch.	He	 _replied	with	discretion_ ETA,	
       meaning	he	made	a	 **careful** ,	guarded	and	humble	inquiry;	and	with	 _discernment_ TEEM,	
       meaning	he	replied	with	good	judgment	and	understanding.	Matthew	10:16
    b. Because	of	his	confidence	in	God,	Daniel	was	able	to	have	great	 **tact** and	self-control	in	a
       life	and	death	situation.	2	Timothy	4:5,	17;	1	Peter	1:13





2. Daniel	2:15	– Daniel	 **politely** ,	yet	boldly asked	about	the	urgency	(CHATSAPH	extreme	
    harshness)	of	the	king’s	death	sentence	for	the	wise	men.
    a. Arioch	unquestioningly	 **obeyed** the	king’s	decree.	The	fact	that	he	took	the	time	to	
       listen	to	Daniel	showed	God’s	intervention.	God	protected	Daniel,	His	servant,	who	
       unquestioningly	depended	on	Him.	Psalm	119:115- 117
    b. By	Daniel’s	actions,	he	not only	prevented	the	 **death** of	his	fellow	advisors,	he	also	
       obtained	Arioch’s	cooperation.	Isaiah	54:4- 5
3. Daniel	2:16	– _So	Daniel	went	in	and	requested	of	the	king	that	he	would	give	him	time,	in	_
    _order	that	he	might	declare	the	interpretation	to	the	king_ .	Daniel’s	success	in	postponing	the	
    executions	ordered	by	the	king	was	yet	another	proof	of	God’s	 **gracious** intervention.
    a. Daniel	asked	for	time	to	consider	the	dream.	He	trusted	the	Lord	to	make	it	known	to	
       him.	Unlike	the	request	from	the	Chaldeans,	Daniel’s	request	was	 **granted**.
    b. Even	though	Daniel	didn’t	know	the	particulars	of	the	dream,	he	 **knew** God	knew	and	
       could	easily	give	him	both	the	dream	and	its	interpretation.
4. Daniel	2:17- 18	 – Daniel’s	first	task was	 **prayer** .	Daniel	and	his	friends	made	specific	requests	
    of	God.
    a. These	young	men	did	not	run	or	panic.	They	chose	to	kneel	before	the	only	one	who	can	
       change	hearts.	First,	they	prayed	for	God’s **mercy** .	This	request	stood	in	stark	contrasted	
       with	the	king’s	lack	of	compassion.
    b. They	also	prayed	concerning	the	 _mystery_ RAZ.	This	clearly	showed	they	were	 **confident**
       God	knew	the	contents	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream.	The	fact	that	they	knew	God	was	
       omniscient	reflects the	depth	of	their spiritual	upbringing.
    c. They	prayed	they	would	not	be	destroyed	with	the	rest	of	the	wise	men.	This	statement	
       may	imply	that	the	executioners	had	already	 **killed** some	of	the	advisors.
    d. Even	though	these	were	 **young** men,	not	seasoned	statesmen,	they	already	knew	how	
       to	trust	the	Lord.	Isaiah	39:6- 7
       1) The	Chaldeans	worshiped	the	 **stars** of	the	heavens,	while	the	Hebrew	youths	
          worshiped	the	God	of	Heaven.
       2) The	Chaldeans	prayed	to	creation,	but	these	young	men	prayed	to	the	Creator.	Was	
          God	able	to	hear	and	answer	their	pleas	in	such	a	 **hostile** environment?	Did	God	
          really	care	for	these	young	men?





**F. Daniel	2:19- 23	 – The	secret	revealed**

1. Daniel	2:19	– God	answered	Daniel	and	his	three	friends’	prayers	by	means	of	a	 **vision** .	This	
    vision	was	God’s	way	of	giving	special	revelation	to	Daniel.	James	5:16
    a. Daniel	2:19a	– _Then	the	mystery	was	_ **_revealed_** _to	Daniel	in	a	night	vision._
       1) Daniel	did	not	explain	the	specifics	of	how	God	made	the	vision	know	to	him,	but	
          Daniel	1:17	clearly	says	that	 **God** was	the	one	who	gave	Daniel	the	ability	to	
          understand	visions	and	dreams.	Daniel	7:15-16,	8:15-16,	9:21- 22
       2) Amazingly	in	this	passage,	God	used	four	inexperienced	Hebrew	youths	to	 **refute**
          the	combined	wisdom	of	the	godless	intellectual	elite.	1	Corinthians	1:27- 29
    b. Daniel	2:19b	– _Then	Daniel	blessed	the	God	of	heaven_ ...	Daniel	responded	to	God's	 **grace**
       with	an	amazing	prayer	of	praise.
       1) In	this	prayer	of	thanksgiving,	he	 **quoted** from	several	Old	Testament	passages,	
          including	Exodus	3,	Psalm	75,	Psalm	139,	and	2	Samuel	14.
       2) He	must	have	heard	these	as	a	child.	(Parents	please	 **teach** your	children	the	Word	
          of	God!)
2. Daniel	2:20	– _Daniel	said,	“Let	the	name	of	God	be	blessed	forever	and	ever,	for	wisdom	and	_
    _power	belong	to	Him_ .	Daniel’s	prayers	showed	he	had	a	clear	understanding	of	God’s	 **Word**.
    a. We	can	only	praise	God's	name	correctly	when	we	know	His	true	essence.	God’s	
       attributes	and	His	holy	character	are	taught	in	the	 **Bible** .	Psalm	9:10,	Proverbs	18:10
    b. Daniel	praised	God’s	 **character** .	He	focused	his	praise	on	God’s	magnificent	
       understanding	and	might.
    c. Daniel’s	praise	was	 **twofold** in	essence.	His	praise	was	for	who	God	is	and	for	what	God	
       had	done	for	them.	In	wisdom	God	gave	the	interpretation	of	the	dream,	and	in	power	
       He	controls	governments.
    d. Contemplating	those	two	issues,	God’s	power	and	wisdom,	was	his	motivation	for	true	
       **praise**.
3. Daniel	2:21	– _It	is	He	who	changes	the	times	and	the	epochs;	He	removes	kings	and	_
    _establishes	kings;	He	gives	wisdom	to	wise	men	and	knowledge	to	men	of	understanding_ .	
    Daniel	was	quick	to	acknowledge	that	God	is	 **sovereign** and	that	He	alone	governs	and	
    controls	the	kingdoms	of	men.	1	Samuel	2:7-8;	Psalm	75:7,	83:18
    a. Daniel’s	prayer	showed	his	thinking	had	not	been	corrupted	through	three	years	of	
       secular	training.	This	is	encouraging	for	young	men	or	women	who	are	learning	in	the	
       halls	of	secular	education.	If	that	is	your	case,	you	do	not	have	to	be	a	 **victim** ,	corrupted	
       by	worldly	thinking.	You	should	hold	on	tightly	to	the	Word	of	God.
    b. _It	is	He	who	changes	the	times	and	the	epochs_ ...	Daniel	knew	that	God	alone	had	the	
       authority	and	power	to	interact	with	and	 **change** the	events	of	history	by	raising	and	
       putting	down	human	governments.






c. It	is	interesting	that	the	antichrist	will	seek	to	counter	God’s	sovereignty.	This	verse	
helps	us	correctly	interpret	Daniel	7:25.	The	antichrist	will	try	to	do	what	God	does.	He	
will	try	to	alter	the	inevitable	plans	of	God	for	human	history.	His	efforts	will	 fail.

4. Daniel	2:22	– _It	is	He	who	reveals	the	profound	and	hidden	things;	He	knows	what	is	in	the	_
    _darkness,	and	the	light	dwells	with	Him_ .	This	statement	is	important	for	understanding	this	
    section.	Daniel	knew	what	we	should	know.	He	knew	that	God	controls	history	and	is	the	
    only	one	who	can	 **reveal** the	future	in	a	reliable manner.	Deuteronomy	29:29,	John	1:4- 5
    a. God	used	dreams	and	visions	to	reveal	the	future	to	Daniel.	Through	these	 **dreams** and	
       visions	and	Daniel’s	interpretation,	given	to	him	by	God,	everyone	from	his	generation	
       to	ours	can	now	gain	a	better	understanding	of	the	future.
    b. Today,	God	reveals	what	we	need	to	know	in	His	completed	Word,	the	Bible.	Down	
       through	history,	God	has	carefully	preserved	His	Word	for	our	present	benefit.	Now	that	
       we	have	God’s	completed	revelation,	we	are	not	to	look	to	visions	or dreams	in	order	to	
       know	the	future.	The	future	is	revealed	in	the	Bible.	We	should	 **know** the	Bible.
5. Daniel	2:23	– Daniel	ended	his	heartfelt	 **thanks** to	God	for	revealing	to	him	the	king’s	dream	
    in	the	vision.
    a. Daniel	2:23a	– _To	You,	O	God	of	my	fathers,	I	give	thanks	and	praise..._ Daniel	mentioned	
       his	 _fathers_ .	This	mention	of	his	biological	 **lineage** brings	to	mind	God’s	contract	with	
       Abraham	and	his	descendants	through	Isaac	and	Jacob.
       1) In	order	to	fulfill	His	obligations	to	Israel	as	promised	in	the	Abrahamic	Covenant,	
          God	supernaturally	 **intervened** in	the	affairs	of	a	pagan	nation.
       2) Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream	gave	the	outline	of	an	intervention	period	of	Gentile	
          domination	over	Israel,	beginning	at	the	time	of	his	dream	and	lasting	until	the	time	
          of	 **Messiah’s** second	coming.
       3) At	the	second	coming	of	Christ,	God	will	finally	 **fulfill** His	covenant	with	Israel.	Israel,	
          in	her	state	of	discipline,	needed	to	be	reminded	of	God’s	covenant	faithfulness.
    b. Daniel	2:23b	– _...for	You	have	given	me	wisdom	and	power;	even	now	You	have	made	_
       _known	to	me	what	we	requested	of	You,	for	You	have	made	known	to	us	the	king’s	_
       _matter.	_ Daniel	clearly	acknowledged	his	friends’	 **prayer** investment	when	he	said,	“ _You	_
       _have	made	known	to	_ **_us_** _the	king’s	matter_ .”
6. Daniel’s	response	to	this	 **crisis** is	an	example	for	us	when	we	face	similar	situations.


a. Knowing	the	truth	of	God’s	Word,	Daniel	responded	in	 faith .	Ephesians	6:10- 20
b. Understanding	their	need	for	God’s	intervention,	Daniel	and	his	friends	looked	to	Him	in	
prayer	for	 wisdom and	guidance.	James	1:5,	5:16b
c. Daniel	prayed	together	with	his	three	 friends ;	together	they	petitioned	God	for	an	
answer.		Matthew	18:20,	Acts	12:5,	2	Corinthians	1:11






d. Always	remember	that	God’s	design	for	trials	is	for	you	to	get	to	know	Him	better	and	
thereby	learn	to	 trust Him	more	fully.	God	never	allows	trials	into	your	life	for	the	
purpose	of	destroying	you.	Psalm	9:10,	Romans	5:3-5,	1	Corinthians	10:13,	James	1:12-
13,	1	Peter	1:6- 7
e. Daniel	thanked	God	for	who	He	is	and	what	He	did.	In	your	trials,	you	too	can	give	
thanks	to	God	for	who	He	is and	for	His	faithfulness	to	His	 promises in	the	Bible.	And
remember	that	no	matter	what	the	outcome...
1) You	can	be	sure	God	 loves you.	Romans	8:31- 35
2) You	can	be	sure	God	is	working	everything	out	for	your	 good (growth).	Romans	8:28
3) You	can	be	sure	God	is	totally	in	 control .	Psalm	83:18,	92:8

**G. Daniel	2:24- 30	 – Daniel’s	personal	audience	with	the	king**

1. Daniel	2:24	– Daniel	followed	correct	 **protocol** by	asking	Arioch,	the	executioner,	to	secure	
    an	audience	for	him	with	the	king.
2. Daniel	2:25	– Arioch	took	 **credit** for	finding	Daniel,	saying,	“ _I	have	found	a	man	among	the	_
    _exiles	from	Judah	who	can	make	the	interpretation	known	to	the	king_ .”
3. Daniel	2:26	– “ _Are	you	able	to	make	known	to	me	the	dream	which	I	have	seen	and	its	_
    _interpretation?_ Despite	his	youth,	Daniel	spoke	boldly	to	the	most	 **powerful** potentate	on	
    earth	at	that	time.	This	took	great	confidence	in	God.	1	Timothy	4:12
4. Daniel	2:27- 28	 – This	dream had	to	do	with	what	would	take	place	in	the	 _latter	days_ ,	or the	
    remaining	days	of	human	 **rule** on	earth,	especially concerning Gentile	domination	of	Israel.	
    a. Daniel	2:27	– _Daniel	answered	before	the	king	and	said,	“As	for	the	mystery	about	which	_
       _the	king	has	inquired,	neither	wise	men,	conjurers,	magicians	nor	diviners	are	_ **_able_** _to	_
       _declare	it	to	the	king...”_ By	this	assertion,	Daniel	both	faulted and shielded the	wise	men.
       1) He	faulted them	by	tactfully	showing	the	bankruptcy	of	the	Babylonian	religious	
          **system** ,	which	was	incapable	of	knowing	or	revealing	the	dream.
       2) He	shielded them	by	wisely	pointing	out	that	 **only** the	God	of	heaven,	someone	
          they	did	not	know	or	worship,	could	reveal	mysteries.
    b. Daniel	2:28	– _However,	there	is	a	God	in	heaven	who	reveals	mysteries, and	He	has	_
       _made	known	to	King	Nebuchadnezzar	what	will	take	place	in	the	latter	days_ .	Daniel	said	
       it	was	the	true	and	living	God who	had	purposefully revealed	the	 **future** of	human	
       government to	the	king.
       1) From	Daniel’s	perspective,	this	was	from	605	BC	until	the	second	 **coming** of	Christ.
       2) Daniel	did	not	mention	the	Church	Age,	because	that	was	a	 **mystery** to	the	Old	
          Testament	prophets.
       3) In	explaining	the	dream	to	the	king,	Daniel	continually	gave	 **credit** to	God.





5. Daniel	2:29	– _As	for	you,	O	king,	while	on	your	bed	your	thoughts	turned	to	what	would	take	_
    _place	in	the	future;	and	He	who	reveals	mysteries	has	made	known	to	you	what	will	take	_
    _place_ .	No	doubt	Nebuchadnezzar	was	surprised	Daniel	knew	what	he	had	been	 **thinking** at	
    the	time	of	his	dream.
6. Daniel	2:30	– It	is	important	to	see	Daniel’s	humility,	He did	not	want	Nebuchadnezzar	to	
    **exalt** him	personally.	He	wanted	to	make	sure	the	king	understood	who	deserved	the	glory.
    a. Daniel	2:30a	– Daniel	did	not	 **deem** himself	superior	to	anyone.	 _But	as	for	me,	this	_
       _mystery	has	not	been	revealed	to	me	for	any	wisdom	residing	in	me	more	than	in	any	_
       _other	living	man_ ...	Daniel	knew	he	was	not wiser	than	any	other	person on	earth.	 1	
       Corinthians	4:6-7,	2	Corinthians	3:5
    b. Daniel	2:30b	– Daniel	saw	himself	as	a	vessel.	... _but	for	the	purpose	of	making	the	_
       _interpretation	known	to	the	king,	and	that	you	may	understand	the	thoughts	of	your	_
       _mind_. Daniel was	used because	he **trusted** God and	willing	presented	himself	for	service.	
       Romans	6:13,	12:1-2;	1	Corinthians	4:1- 2	

**H. Daniel	2:31- 35	 – Daniel’s	accurate	description	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream**

1. Daniel	2:31	– _You,	O	king,	were	looking	and	behold,	there	was	a	single	great	statue;	that	_
    _statue,	which	was	large	and	of	extraordinary	splendor,	was	standing	in	front	of	you,	and	its	_
    _appearance	was	_ **_awesome_**.
    a. This	dream	described	the	coming	domination	of	humankind	by	various	world	 **empires**
       until	the	end	of	fallen	man’s	rule	on	earth.
    b. The	word	 _awesome_ DECHAL	in	Aramaic	means	to	 **fear** .	The	statue	Nebuchadnezzar	saw	
       in	his	dream	was	 _large	and	of	extraordinary	splendor_ ;	meaning	it	was	huge	and	dreadful.
2. Daniel	2:32- 33	 – Daniel	proceeded	to	revealed	the	 **details** of	the	statue.	 _The	head	of	that	_
    _statue	was	made	of	fine	gold,	its	breast	and	its	arms	of	silver,	its	belly	and	its	thighs	of	_
    _bronze,	its	legs	of	iron,	its	feet	partly	of	iron	and	partly	of	clay_.
    a. The	statue	portrayed	both	diversity	and	unity.	It	was	a	 **single** statue	made	of	five	
       substances.
       1) The	head	was	made	of	 **gold**.
       2) The	chest	and	arms	were	made	of	 **silver**.
       3) The	abdomen	and	thighs	were	made	of	 **bronze**.
       4) The	legs	were	made	of	 **iron**.
       5) The	feet	were	made	of	iron	 **mixed** with	clay.
    b. The	four	metals	in	the	statue	declined	in	 **value** from	top	to	bottom.	The	weight	of	the	
       upper	metals	was	greater	than	the	weight	of	the	lower	metals.	The	metals	also	
       transitioned	from	softer	metals	at	the	top	to	harder	more	durable	metals	at	the	bottom.
    c. The	 **head** was	one	solid	piece	of	gold;	it	was	the	least	divided	part	of	the	statue.






d. All	the	other	sections	were	comprised of	left	and	right sides	or	even	two body	 parts ,	
additionally	the	feet	were	made	of	two	non-mixing	substances:	iron	and	clay.
e. The	feet	were the	 weakest part	of	the	statue	because	they	were	composed	of	two	
incompatible materials.

3. Daniel	2:34	– _You	continued	looking	until	a	stone	was	cut	out	without	hands,	and	it	struck	_
    _the	statue	on	its	feet	of	iron	and	clay	and	crushed	them_ .	The	statue	was	destroyed	with	a	
    crushing	blow	to	the	 **feet**.
    a. The	statue,	as	we	will	see,	represents	succeeding	world	empires,	known	as	the	
       kingdoms	of	 **men**.
    b. The	stone	that	destroyed	the	statue	represents	the	 **Messiah** and	His	eternal	kingdom.
4. Daniel	2:35	– _But	the	stone	that	struck	the	statue	became	a	great	mountain	and	filled	the	_
    _whole	earth_ .	Christ	will	become	the	 **universal** and	perfect	ruler	of	all	time.	After	his	arrival	
    fallen	humanity	will	never	again	rule	humankind.

**I. Daniel	2:36- 45	 – Daniel’s	accurate	interpretation	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream**

1. Daniel	2:36	– Daniel	perfectly	described	the	dream	Nebuchadnezzar	had	never	previously	
    disclosed	to	anyone.	This	fact	would	have	fully	 **validated** his	ensuing	interpretation	to	
    Nebuchadnezzar.
2. Daniel	2:37- 38	 – _You,	O	king,	are	the	king	of	kings,	to	whom	the	God	of	heaven	has	given	the	_
    _kingdom,	the	power,	the	strength	and	the	glory_ .	Of	the	four	coming	empires	that	would	
    adversely	affect	Israel,	the	Babylonian	Empire	had the	greatest	 **unity** within	its	borders.	It	
    allowed	no	competition	from	other	cultures	and	forced	people	to	conform	to	its	ways.
    a. Daniel	declared	that	Nebuchadnezzar	was	represented	by	the	 **head** of	gold.
    b. He	was	the	 **greatest** king	of	Babylon,	and	quite	possibly,	the	most	authoritative
       potentate	to	ever	live.	Jeremiah	27:4- 8
3. Daniel	2:39- 43	 – Daniel	described	the	materials	that	made	up	the	image	and	how	they	
    represented	upcoming	 **earthly** kingdoms.
    a. Daniel	2:39	– Daniel	did	not	presently	 **know** the	identities	of	these	future	empires,	but	
       he	emphasized	the	definite	changes	that	would	occur	with	their	successive	arrivals.
       1) The	decreasing	value	of	the	metals	and	their	increasing	rigidity	were	ominous	
          **predictions** concerning	these	forthcoming	kingdoms.
       2) The	declining	value	and	weight	of	the	metals	showed	that	the	quality	of	the	
          kingdoms	of	human	rule	on	earth	will	 **decline** with	time.
       3) The	fact	that	the	materials	increased	in	strength	from	top	to	bottom	may	indicate	
          the	kingdoms	will	get	more	 **overbearing** in	their	governance	as	time	progresses.
    b. Daniel	2:40	– Daniel	described	the	fourth	and	final	kingdom	as	being	so	strong	it	would	
       trample	all	things:	 _It	will	crush	and	break	all	these	in	pieces_ .	This	may	indicate	that	the	
       fourth	empire	will	have	superior	military	might	or	unlimited	 **control** over	people.






c. Daniel	2:41	– ... it	will	be	a	divided	kingdom ...	Daniel	stated	that	the	fourth	kingdom	
would	be,	or	become,	 divided .	This	is	probably	why	it	is	seen	as	having	two	legs	and	two
feet.
d. Daniel	2:42	– The	final	kingdom included	the	 feet of	the	statue,	which	were	a	mix	of	clay	
and	iron.	This	indicates	that	the	final	kingdom	would	become	(in	its	“foot”	stage)	an	
amalgamation	of	nations. Part	of	this	kingdom	will	be	strong	and	part	will	be	brittle.
e. Daniel	2:43	– And	in	that	you	saw	the	iron	mixed	with	common	clay,	they	will	combine	
with	one	another	in	the	seed	of	men;	but	they	will	not	adhere	to	one	another,	even	as	
iron	does	not	combine	with	pottery .	Although	this	empire	will	be	strong,	it	may	be	that	
infighting	due	to	multiculturalism	will	 weaken it.
1) Since	iron	and	clay	cannot	 merge ,	the	fourth	kingdom	will	continue	to	have	great	
strength	(iron)	but	will	lack	unity	(clay) an	indispensable commodity to	any	empire.
2) It	will	not	have	the	cultural	 unity achieved	by the	first	empire,	Babylon.

**J. Daniel	2:44- 45	 – A	kingdom	that	will	never	be	destroyed**

1. Daniel	2:44	– Finally	the	Kingdom of	Heaven	will	come. Isaiah	2:2,	Matthew	6:10
    a. Daniel	2:44a	– _In	the	days	of	those	kings	the	God	of	heaven	will	set	up	a	kingdom	which	_
       _will never	be	destroyed,	and	that	kingdom	will	not	be	left	for	another	people._ The	
       statement	“ _in	the	days	of	those	kings..._ ”	refers	to	the	rulers	of	the	“ **iron** ”	kingdom	who	
       will	be	ruling	at	the	time	God	establishes	His	eternal	kingdom.
       1) _In	the	days	of	those	kings...	_ We	perceive	that	the	final	end	of	the	“iron mixed	with	
          clay” empire	will	be	a	federation	of	 **kings**.
       2) This	final	grouping	of	kings	is	described	elsewhere	as	 _ten	_ **_horns_** .	The	ten	toes	on	the	
          statue	are	probably	representative	of	this	fact	as	well,	though	the	text	is	not	explicit	
          in	that	description.	Daniel	7:20,	24;	Revelation	17:3,	7,	12,	16
    b. Daniel	2:44b	– _...it	will	crush	and	put	an	end	to	all	these	kingdoms,	but	it	will	itself	_
       _endure	forever_ .	Christ’s	kingdom,	which	will	come	on	the	heels	of	God’s	abrupt	
       judgment,	will	 **destroy** all	other	kingdoms.	(... _a	stone	was	cut	out	without	hands,	and	it	_
       _struck	the	statue	on	its	feet	of	iron	and	clay	and	crushed	them._ vs.	34)
2. Daniel	2:45	– Daniel	finished	by	emphasizing	the	 **truth** and	trustworthiness	of	the	dream	
    and	his	interpretation. You	can	be	certain	that	God	will	supernaturally	intervene	and	
    destroy	all	rule	of	fallen	man	and	establish	His	Eternal	Kingdom.

**K. Daniel	2:46- 49	 – Daniel	gets	promoted**

1. Daniel	2:46	– Then	King	Nebuchadnezzar	fell	on	his	face	and	did	 **homage** to	Daniel,	and	gave	
    orders	to	present	to	him	an	offering	and	fragrant	incense.	In	that	moment,	Nebuchadnezzar	
    was	overwhelmed.
    a. Nebuchadnezzar	was	 **stunned** by	the	interpretation.	In	a	manner totally	uncharacteristic	
       of	any	king,	Nebuchadnezzar	fell	down	and	paid	homage	to	Daniel.	Their	roles	were	
       reversed	and	the	king	did	to	Daniel	what	everyone	usually	did	to	the	king.






b. Nebuchadnezzar	rewarded	Daniel	just	as	he	promised	to	do	for	the	 person who	
interpreted	his	dream.	(Daniel	2:6)

2. Daniel	2:47	– Although	Nebuchadnezzar	praised	Daniel’s	God,	it	is	interesting	to	note	that	
    he	did	not	recognize	Daniel’s	God	as	the	one	and	 **only** Creator	God.	Nevertheless,	he	was	
    growing in	his	knowledge	of	the	truth	because	he	did	acknowledge	God’s	sovereignty.
3. Daniel	2:48	– _Then	the	king	promoted	Daniel	and	gave	him	many	great	gifts,	and	he	made	_
    _him	ruler	over	the	whole	province	of	Babylon	and	_ **_chief_** _prefect	over	all	the	wise	men	of	_
    _Babylon_.
    a. In	reality,	it	was	God	who	moved	the	king	to	 **promote** Daniel	to	the	position	of	governor	
       of	Babylon.	Genesis	41:39-44,	1	Samuel	2:8
    b. Daniel	also	became	the	chief	leader	of	all	the	 **wise** men	of	Babylon.
    c. This	was	significant	in	that	Daniel	was	able	to	set	up	a	new	sect	of	wise	men	in Babylon	
       who	came	to	be	called	the	 **Magi** .	In	Matthew	2:1-2	we	read	about	Magi	who	came	from	
       the	east	to	Jerusalem	to	celebrate	the	birth	of	the	 _king	of	the	Jews_.
4. Daniel	2:49a	– And _Daniel	made	request	of	the	king,	and	he	appointed	Shadrach,	Meshach	_
    _and	Abed-nego	over	the	administration	of	the	province	of	Babylon...	_ In	His	foreknowledge,	
    power	and	 **grace** ,	God	put	these	four	men	in	influential	positions	in	government.
    a. These	men could	 **advocate** for	their	fellow	countrymen	who	would	soon	be	deported	
       from	Jerusalem	to	Babylon	in	two	separate	waves	(597	BC	and	586	BC).
    b. God	prepared	the	way	for	his	people	Israel	even	though	in	severe judgment	they	were	
       being	deported	for	their	spiritual	infidelity	through	the	worship	of	 **idols**.
5. Daniel	2:49b	– ... _while	Daniel	was	at	the	king’s	court_ .	The	fact	that	Daniel	was	specifically	
    governing	in	 _the	king’s	court_ and	 **_ruler_** _over	the	whole	province_ (vs.	48)	put	him	in	a	higher	
    position	than	Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego.	This	could	explain	why	Daniel	was	absent	
    at	the	event	where his	three	friends	were	cast	into	the	fiery	furnace.

**L. Explaining	this	prophecy**

1. God	used	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream	to	give	us	an	 **outline** of	the	kingdoms	that	will rule	the	
    earth	during	the	 _times	of	the	Gentiles_ (Luke	21:20-28),	or	 _the	latter	days_ (Dan.	2:28).
    a. Daniel	1:1- 2	 – In	605	BC,	when	Nebuchadnezzar	first	defeated	Judah,	God	began	to	
       allow	Gentile	nations,	one	after	the	other,	to	dominate	Israel	and	build	world	 **empires**.
    b. Jeremiah	33:15	– Because	Israel	habitually	failed	to	follow	God,	she	forfeited	her	rights
       to	sovereignty	as	a	 **nation** .	Israel	will	not	regain	complete	sovereignty	until	the	
       Millennial	Kingdom	when	Messiah	rules.	Isaiah	11:2-5,	11-12;	Jeremiah	33:15
    c. Psalm	89:26- 27	 – In	fulfillment	of	the	 **Davidic** Covenant,	the	King	of	kings,	Jesus	Christ,	
       will	rule	on	earth	forever	as	both	King	of	the	Jews	and	king	of	the	world.	Genesis	49:8-
       12;	Jeremiah	23:5-6,	8;	Luke	1:32- 33





2. The	head	of	 **gold** was	Babylon.	As	the	dream	indicated,	Babylon	was the	first	empire	
    prophesied	to	overshadow Israel.	Daniel	2:32,	38;	Jeremiah	51:7
    a. The	head	of	gold	represented	Babylon’s	unsurpassed	 **riches** and	power.
       1) Interestingly,	gold	was	so	plentiful	in	Babylon	that	sometimes	 **walls** were	overlaid	in	
          gold.
       2) Babylonian	kings	were	 **absolute** monarchs.	No	one	could	counter	their	dictates.
    b. The	Babylonian	Empire	lasted	from	605	to	539	BC.	Its	“golden”	qualities	began	
       diminishing	soon	after	Nebuchadnezzar’s	 **death** in	562	BC.	Jeremiah	25:12
3. The	second	empire	to	dominate	Israel	was	represented	by	the	chest	and	arms	of	silver.	This	
    empire	was	constituted	by	the	 **joint** Medo-Persian	Empire.	Daniel	2:32,	5:28
    a. The	Medo-Persian	Empire	lasted	from	539	to	331	BC.	Although	Cyrus	the	Great	of	Persia	
       was	the	first	ruler	of	this	kingdom,	 **Darius** the	Mede	co-ruled	over	Babylon,	the	
       Chaldean	region.
    b. Persia	was	greater	than	Babylon	in	military	might	and	in	the	amount	of	territory	
       conquered,	but	 **inferior** in	national	cohesiveness.
    c. The	Persian	kings	were	not	absolute	monarchs.	They	were	limited	in	power	by	the	 **law**
       of	the	Medes	and	Persians,	which	limited	the	authority	of	the	monarch	to	change	laws	
       impulsively.
    d. Interestingly,	silver	 **money** was	used	in	the	Persian	Empire	as	a	medium	of	exchange.
4. The	belly	and	thighs	of	bronze	represented	the	 **Greek** Empire,	which	was	the	third	empire	
    to	overshadow	Israel.
    a. Greek	rule	impacted	 **Israel** directly	from	334	BC	to	146	BC,	and	indirectly,	through	
       military	harassment,	until	63	BC.	Ezekiel	27:13;	Daniel	2:32,	8:21
    b. After	Alexander	the	Great	overthrew	the	Persian	Empire,	he	went	on	to	 **conquer** the	
       entire	civilized	world,	traveling	all	the	way	to	India.	Alexander	was	successful	in	merging	
       many	culturally	diverse	nations.
    c. The	Greek	Empire	was	territorially	larger	than	both	the	Babylonian	and	Persian	Empires,	
       but	 **weaker** because	of	a	somewhat	more	democratic	government.
    d. After	Alexander	the	Great’s	untimely	death	in	323	BC,	the	Greek	Empire	 **divided** into	
       four	autonomous	regions	that	often	warred	against	each	other.
    e. Interestingly,	the	weapons	in	the	Greek	Empire	were	made	primarily	of	 **bronze**.
5. The	fourth	and	final	human-led	empire	represented	by	the	legs	of	pure	iron	and	the	feet	of	
    iron	mixed	with	clay	was	the	 **Roman** Empire.
    a. Although	Rome	was	founded	in	753	BC	and	became	a	republic in	509	BC,	it	did	not	
       become	a world	 **empire** until	27	BC.





b. The	Roman	Empire	became	 **divided** into	two	empires:	The Western	Roman	Empire	
whose	capital	was	Rome	and	the	Eastern	Roman	Empire,	or	the	Byzantine	Empire,	
whose	capital	was	Constantinople.

c. The	Western	Roman	Empire	lasted	until	476	AD	when	it	was	conquered	by	the	 **Goths**.

d. The	Eastern	Roman	Empire	lasted	until	1453	AD	when	the	 **Ottoman** Turks	captured	
Constantinople.	It	was	renamed	Istanbul.

e. The	two	 **legs** of	the	statue	fittingly represent	the	division	of	this empire.

f. Roman	domination	of	Israel	began	in	63	BC	when	 **Pompey** conquered	Israel,	and	it	
continued	well	after	the	empire	was	divided	into	east	and	west.

g. **Iron** weapons	made	Rome’s	military	might	greater	than	the	previous	empires.

h. Although	iron	describes	Roman	rule,	the	mixture	of	iron	and	clay	in	the	feet	of	the	
statue	may	represent	a	unity	weakness	in	the	final	stages	of	Roman	rule	before	Christ	
returns.	This	might	be	caused	by	its	religious	 **diversity** and	the	multinational	nature	of	
its	final	state.
1) The	 **ten** toes	of	the	statue	probably	refer	to	the	ten	kings	(nations	or	regions)	of	the	
Roman	Empire	that	will	unite	to	rule	during	the	coming	final	days	of	this	empire.	
Daniel	7:24,	Revelation	17:12- 13
2) Since	the	official	fall	of	the	Roman	Empire,	its	residues	have	mutated	and	are	found	
in	eastern	and western	European	nations,	as	well	as	in	many	other	democracies	and	
republics	around	the	 **world** that	use	a	Roman	rule-of-law	type of	government.

i. Since	the	legs	and	feet	of	the	statue	were	described	by	Daniel	as	one	 **unit** ,	we	should	
expect	Roman	influence	and	domination	to	continue	influencing	governments	until	
Christ’s	return	at	the	Second	Advent.	Roman	rule	was	different	than	Greek	rule	in	that	it	
was	divided	three	ways:	between	the	Caesars, the	senate	and	the	people.

j. The	final	aspect	of	the	Roman	Empire	will	be	a	loose	 **affiliation** of	ten	nations	that	will	
come	to	be	controlled by	an	extremely	charismatic	world	leader	called	the	antichrist.

k. You	may	disagree	but	the	authors	of	this	curriculum	do	not	believe	the	Roman	empire	
completely	vanished	but	has	rather	morphed	into	 **many** national	governments (now	
called	democracies).	After	the	fall	of	both	Rome	and	Constantinople	the	ruling	class
dispersed	into	the	Germanic	and	Russian	regions.
1) Roman	rule	of	 **law** can	still	be	seen	in	many nations that	were once part	of	the	
Roman	empire.
2) This east-west	 **tension** that	existed	during the	Roman	empire	can	still	be	felt in
Eurasia.	These	Eurasian governments	compete	for	influence (especially	in	regard	to
the	Middle	East	and	in	particular Israel).	
a) Back	when	Russia	began	to dominate, her	leader	was	labeled	Tsar	( **Czar** ),	the	
Russian	word	for	Caesar.






b) More	recently	when	Germany	sought	to	dominate the	world,	her	leader	was	
called	 Kaiser ,	the	German	word	for	Caesar.
3) These	gentile nations	will	overshadow	Israel’s	sovereignty	to	some	degree	or	
another until	a	 rock ,	cut	without	hands,	comes	and	destroys	them	all.
4) This	Roman	“ iron ”	influence	will	again	coalesce and	solidify	as	 the	times	of	the	
gentiles draws	to	a	conclusion.

6. Let’s	talk	about	the	 **stone** cut	without	hands	which	is the	coming	Kingdom	of	God.
    a. At	His	second	coming	at	the	end	of	the	Tribulation,	the	Lord	Jesus	Christ	will	destroy	all	
       kingdoms	of	men.	This	will	be	so	thorough	that	no	remnant	of	sinful	 **rule** will	remain.	
       Revelation	19:11- 21
    b. This	cataclysmic	act	of	God	will	destroy	earthly	human	kingdoms **forever** .	No	element of	
       the	rule	of	sinful	man	will	be	absorbed,	adapted	or	blended	into	the	Millennial	Kingdom.
    c. The	eternal	kingdom	established	by	the	Lord	Jesus	Christ	will	be	perfect	in	 **justice** and	
       the	extreme	contrast of	all	previous	kingdoms	ruled	by	sinful	man.
    d. God’s	destruction	of	the	kingdom	of	man	will	be	 **sudden** and	dreadful.
    e. Knowing	that	Christ	will	bring	 **victory** for	righteousness	and	will	govern	with	perfection	
       in	the	Millennial	Kingdom	should	give	us	great	assurance in	the	present.	2	Peter	3:10- 18

**M. Thoughts	from	Daniel	chapter	two**

1. Who	really	rules	on	earth?	Daniel	 2	 convincingly	answers that	question:	 **God** rules!
2. How	should	we	speak	in	a	hostile	situation?	Daniel	decided	to	boldly,	but	respectfully,	speak
    the	 **truth** to	this absolute	monarch,	Nebuchadnezzar.	He	did	this	because	he	feared	and	
    served	an	even	more	powerful	Monarch,	the	God	of	Heaven.
3. How	should	you	walk in	light	of	God’s	sovereignty?	Should	we	walk	as	proud	Arioch	who	
    took	credit	for	finding	Daniel	or	as	Daniel	who	gave	all	credit	and	glory	to	God?	Like	Daniel	
    we should	 **_humble_** [ourselves]	 _under	the	mighty	hand	of	God_ .	1	Peter	5:6





**VI.Daniel	3:1- 30	 – Worldviews	at	War**

**A. Daniel	3:1- 7	 – Forced	to	bow**

1. Daniel	3:1a	– _Nebuchadnezzar	the	king	made	an	_ **_image_** _of	gold,	the	height	of	which	was	_
    _sixty	cubits	and	its	width	six	cubits..._
    a. Since	in	the	dream	of	chapter	two	Nebuchadnezzar	was	represented	as	the	head	of	
       gold,	he	decided	to	build	a	 **giant** statue of	pure	gold.
       1) Sixty	cubits	is	equal	to	90	feet,	or	30	meters.	That’s	how	 **tall** the	statue	was.
       2) Six	cubits	is	the	equivalent	of	9	feet,	or	3	meters.	If	this	were	the	width	from	
          shoulder	to	shoulder,	it	would	have	been	a	disproportionate	statue	of	a	person;	
          therefore,	it	may	have	referred	to	the	 **thickness** of	the	statue	from	chest	to	back.
    b. Based	on	his	pagan	worldview,	Nebuchadnezzar	reinterpreted	Daniel’s	 **clear	** explanation	
       of	the	dream.	
       1) The	fact	that	he	was	the	head	of	gold,	must	have	resonated	with	Nebuchadnezzar’s	
          **pride** .		He	obviously	envisioned	something	other	than	what	God	meant.
       2) One	of	Satan’s	favorite	tricks	is	to	 **twist** the	truth.	Nebuchadnezzar’s	original	dream	
          that	exalted	the	wisdom	and	foreknowledge	of	God	was	now	twisted	into	an	idol	
          that	exalted	man.
       3) Nebuchadnezzar	may	have	seen	nationwide	allegiance	to	this	statue	as	a	way	of	
          creating	 **unity** in	his	country.
       4) The	Chaldeans	probably	saw	it	as	a	way	of	getting	 **rid** of	the	Jews,	i.e.,	antisemitism.
       5) Satan,	who	was	the	real	mastermind	behind	this	plan,	has	always	tried	to	 **destroy**
          God’s	chosen	people.
2. Daniel	3:1b	– Nebuchadnezzar	had	this	golden	image	 _set	it	up	on	the plain	of	_ **_Dura_** _in	the	_
    _province	of	Babylon_.
    a. This	plain	was	located	10	km	(6	mi)	from	Babylon.	There may	have	been	 **kilns** nearby	
       used	for	smelting	and	brick-making.
    b. Typically,	kilns for	brickmaking were	roomy	enough	for	 **people** to	walk	around	in.
3. Daniel	3:2	– Nebuchadnezzar	commanded	virtually	every	important	 **member** of	his	
    bureaucracy	to	assemble	in	worship	of	this	statue.	These	political	leaders	represented	the	
    numerous	peoples	and	countries	that	constituted	the	Babylonian	empire.
    a. Daniel	recorded	the	eight-levels	of	political	 **guests** in	precise	order	to	emphasize	the	
       importance	the	king	placed	on	this	mandatory	summons.
       1) A	 _satrap_ was	the	 **highest** regional	authority	in	a	province.
       2) A	 _prefect_ was	a	regional	military	 **chief**.
       3) A	 _governor_ was	a	captain,	or	regional	 **ruler** ,	in	a	province.






4) A	 counselor (or	adviser)	was	a	high-ranking	 judge.
5) A	 treasurer was	a	provincial	 treasury superintendent.
6) A	 judge was	a	lower-ranking	 adviser or	judge.
7) A	 magistrate was	a	lower-level	 legal official.
8) A	 ruler of	province was	a	grassroots	assistant	to	the	provincial	satrap.
b. Nebuchadnezzar	knew	that	if	every	government	 official worshiped	the	image,	common	
citizens	would	immediately	be	compelled	to	follow	suit.
c. After	his	defeat	in	chapter	2	this	mandated	assembly	was	likely orchestrated	by	Satan	to	
regain	absolute	 control over his	crown	jewel,	Babylon.

4. Daniel	3:3	– All	the	officials... _were	assembled	for	the	dedication	of	the	image	that	_
    _Nebuchadnezzar	the	king	had	set	up;	and	they	_ **_stood_** _before	the	image	that	Nebuchadnezzar	_
    _had	set	up_ .	
    a. Dedication	day	arrived.	 **Everyone** was	there.
    b. The	repetition	of	the	phrase,	“ _the	king	had	set	up_ ”	highlights	the	fact	that	
       Nebuchadnezzar	personally	presided	over	this	endeavor.	This	was	his pet	 **project**.
5. Daniel	3:4- 5	 – _Then	the	herald	loudly	proclaimed:	“To	you	the	command	is	given,	O	peoples,	_
    _nations	and	men	of	every	language,	that	at	the	_ **_moment_** _you	hear	the	sound	of ...all	kinds	of	_
    _music,	you	are	to	fall	down	and	worship	the	golden	image	that	Nebuchadnezzar	the	king	has	_
    _set	up_.
    a. Nebuchadnezzar	used	the	power	of	government	to	 **impose** this	worship	on	the	empire.
    b. This	presented	a	conundrum	of	epic	proportions	for	 **law** - abiding	believers in	Yahweh.
    c. To	not	worship	this	image	would	be	seen	as	disloyalty	to	king	and	 **country** ,	but	to	
       worship	the	image	would	have	been	sinful	disloyalty	to	God.	Matthew	6:24,	Acts	5:29
    d. This	kind	of	 **forced** conformity	is	not	unusual	for	corrupt	governments.
    e. Weak	believers	in	situations	like	this	might	easily	rationalize	this	worship	ritual	as	a	
       mere	loyalty	oath,	like	a	salute	to	a	flag,	but	we	will	see	that	the	Hebrew	youths	
       understood	the	significance	of	this	forced	 **idolatry**.
6. Daniel	3:6	– _“But	whoever	does	not	fall	down	and	worship	shall	immediately	be	cast	into	the	_
    _midst	of	a	furnace	of	blazing	fire.”_ The	king	threatened	to	burn	to	death	all	who	refused	to	
    worship	his	statue.	He	could	fire	up a	nearby	kiln	for	the	grim	 **deed**.
7. Daniel	3:7	– _Therefore	at	that	time,	when	all	the	peoples	heard	the	sound	of	the	horn,	flute,	_
    _lyre,	trigon,	psaltery,	bagpipe	and	all	kinds	of	music,	all	the	peoples,	nations	and	men	of	_
    _every	language	_ **_fell_** _down	and	worshiped	the	golden	image	that	Nebuchadnezzar	the	king	_
    _had	set	up_.
    a. We	should	note	that	the	 **_times_** _of	the	Gentiles_ started	with	a	form	of	compulsory	
       idolatry	and	will	likewise	end	with	the	same.	Revelation	13:3- 8






b. During	the	Tribulation,	an	image	of	the	antichrist,	who	will	be	the	final	great	human	
ruler,	will	be	erected,	and	people	will	again	be	 required to	worship	the	image	or	face	
death. Revelation	13:11- 18

**B. Daniel	3:8- 12	 – Informants**

1. Daniel	3:8	– The	story	takes	a	dark	twist.	 _For	this	reason,	at	that	time	certain	Chaldeans	_
    _came	forward	and	brought	charges	against	the	Jews_ .	These	Chaldeans	were	out	for	no	
    good.	They	maliciously	slandered	the	three	Jews	who	 **refused** to	bow	to	the	statue.
    a. The	word	 _brought_ AKAL	as	seen	in	the	statement,	“ _brought	charges,_ ”	literally	means	“to	
       consume	or	to	devour.”	Idiomatically	this	described	someone	ravenously	accusing	a	foe.	
       The	Chaldeans	were	salivating	at	the	opportunity	to	 **charge** these	Jews	before	the	king.
    b. This	same	word	is	used	in	Daniel	4:33	to	describe	Nebuchadnezzar’s	ravenous _feasting_
       on	grass	like	an	animal.	Also,	in	referring	to	Daniel’s	accusers	when	he	was	thrown	into	
       the	lion’s	 **den** (Dan.	6:24),	this	same	word	was	translated	“ _maliciously	accused._ ”
    c. It	was	the	Chaldeans,	the	 **elite** establishment	of	wise	men	in	Babylon,	who	sprang	this	
       trap	on	these	young	Hebrews.	This	had	probably	been	in	the	works	for	some	time.
       1) Daniel	1:4	– In	chapter	one,	the	Chaldeans	were	unsuccessful	in	changing	the	 **minds**
          of	the	Jewish	youths	through	forced	acceptance	of	Chaldean	names,	language	and	
          diet.
       2) Daniel	2:10,	27	– Likewise,	they	had	been	outdone	by	a	Jewish	 **youth** in	chapter	two	
          when	Daniel	did	what	none	of	them	could	do.
    d. How	did	the	Chaldeans	suddenly	make	an	appearance	at	this	event,	when	they	were	not	
       part	of	the	 **list** of	invited	dignitaries	(Dan.	3:2)?	These	religious	“wise	men”	were	
       obviously	up	to	no	good.
2. Daniel	3:9	– _They	responded	and	said	to	Nebuchadnezzar	the	king:	“O	king,	live	forever!_ The	
    Chaldeans	addressed	the	king	respectfully,	but	their	 **words** harbored	hypocrisy.
3. Daniel	3:10- 11	 – By	repeating	the	king’s	decree	word	for	word,	they	presented	themselves	
    as	loyal	subjects	who	desired	to	uphold	the	 **laws** of	the	state.
4. Daniel	3:12a	– _“There	are	certain	_ **_Jews_** _whom_ **_you_** _have	appointed	over	the	administration	of	_
    _the	province	of	Babylon...”_ The	Chaldeans	implied	that	King	Nebuchadnezzar	had	made	a	
    **mistake** by	placing	 _certain Jews_ in	his	government.
5. Daniel	3:12b	– _“These	men,	O	king,	have	disregarded	_ **_you_** _;	they	do	not	serve	your	gods	or	_
    _worship	the	golden	image	which	you	have	set	up.”_ The	Chaldeans	knew	how	to	 **manipulate**
    the	king	to	do	what	they	wanted.
    a. They	appealed	to	Nebuchadnezzar’s	 **pride** ,	knowing	the	king	would	never	back	down	if	
       he	thought	these	men	were	in	open	defiance	of	him.






b. Proverbs	16:18	(KJV)	says,	“ Pride	goes	before	destruction,	and	a	haughty	spirit	before	a	
fall .”	Even	though	he	had	publically	given	these	three	young	Jewish	men	their	positions	
of	authority,	the	king	would	never	accept	being	seen	as	 weak .	He	would	have	to	exert	
his	power.
c. The	Chaldeans	deemed	disobedience	to	the	king’s	edict	a	rejection	of	the	 gods of	
Babylon.
d. Of	course,	Satan	was	behind	it	all.	Their	attack	highlighted	the	antisemitism,	or	hatred	of	
the	Jews,	which	has	been	a	major	 theme in many	human	governments	and	societies	
during	the	 times	of	the	Gentiles.

**C. Daniel	3:13- 18	 – Nebuchadnezzar’s	display	of	anger before	every	prominent	**


leader	of	the	empire	provided	the	perfect	opportunity	for	God	to	be	publicly	
esteemed.

1. Daniel	3:13	– Placing	two	words	with	the	same	meaning	( _rage_ REGAZ	and	 _anger_ CHAMAH,	
    in	Aramaic)	side	by	side	was	a	grammatical	construction	(hendiadys)	used	to	intensify	the	
    depiction	of	the	king’s	 **fury**.
    a. In	his	pride,	Nebuchadnezzar	 **concluded** that	by	not	worshipping	his	statue	these	Jewish	
       youths	were	publically	and	purposefully	defying	him.	Proverbs	16:32
    b. Nebuchadnezzar	epitomized	the	 **foolishness** that	results	from	a lack	of	self-control.
2. Daniel	3:14	– _Nebuchadnezzar	responded	and	said	to	them,	“Is	it	true,	Shadrach,	Meshach	_
    _and Abed-nego,	that	you	do	not	serve	my	gods	or	worship	the	golden	_ **_image_** _that	I	have	set	_
    _up?”_
    a. Nebuchadnezzar	made	the	situation	into	a	theological	 **challenge**.
    b. Nebuchadnezzar	wickedly	disregarded	what	he	learned	in	Daniel	2:47,	that	Israel’s	God	
       was	 **superior** to the	Babylonian	gods.
3. Daniel	3:15a	– _Now	if	you	are	ready,	at	the	moment	you	hear	...	all	kinds	of	music,	to	fall	_
    _down	and	worship	the	image	that	I	have	made,	very	well._ The	king	gave	the	three	young	
    Jewish	rulers	an	opportunity	to	 **change** their	minds.
4. Daniel 3:15b	– _But	if	you	do	not	worship,	you	will	immediately	be	cast	into	the	midst	of	a	_
    _furnace	of	blazing	fire..._ The	king’s	threat	made	it	clear	that	they’d	be	 **killed** by	fire	if	they	
    did	not	worship	his	golden	image.
5. Daniel	3:15c	– ... _and	what	god	is	there	who	can	deliver	you	out	of	my	hands?_ King	
    Nebuchadnezzar	was	about	to	be	introduced	to	the	God	who	could	easily	deliver	anyone	
    from	his	hands.	His	 **defiance** showed	the	depth	of	his	arrogance.
    a. Although	Nebuchadnezzar	already	knew	that	the	God	of	the	Israelites	was	able	to	reveal	
       dreams,	he	could	not	 **accept** that	He,	or	any	other	god,	could	deliver	anyone	from	his	
       power.






b. In	pride,	Nebuchadnezzar	was	self- deluded .	He	felt	superior	to	Israel	and	her	God.	He	
probably	thought	he	had	proven	his	superiority	by	subjugating	Jerusalem,	exiling	many	
royal	captives,	and	taking	gold	from	the	temple.

6. Daniel	3:16	– _Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego	replied	to	the	king,	“O	Nebuchadnezzar,	_
    _we	do	not	need	to	give	you	an	answer	concerning	this	matter_ .	These	three	men	were	not	
    being	rude;	they	were	simply	telling	the	king	they	would	not	try	to	 **defend** their	actions.
    a. Nebuchadnezzar’s	golden	statue	took	months,	maybe	even	years,	to	build.	The	four	
       Jewish	administrators	must	have	suspected	that	their	enemies	would	try	to	use	this	to	
       destroy	them.	Their	firm	 **decision** was	probably	predetermined	all	along.
    b. As	believers,	we	also	may	be	pressured	to	compromise	someday.	We	need	to	be	
       resolute	long	before	we	face	these	 **inevitable** persecutions.	In	regard	to	our	faith,	we	
       would	not	want	to	compromise	in	a	moment	of	pressure.
7. Daniel	3:17	– These	young	men	faced	tremendous	pressure	to	conform	to	the	 **state** -
    mandated	idolatry.	The	deliverance	they	needed	was	not	a	deliverance	from	hell	
    (justification)	but	a	kind	of	daily	deliverance	(sanctification)	we	all must	trust	God	to	give	us	
    in	similar	situations.
    a. Daniel	3:17a	– _If	it	be	so,	our	God	whom	we	serve	is	able	to	deliver	us	from	the	furnace	_
       _of	blazing	fire...	_ Although	they	faced	death	by	incineration,	they	remained	confident	in	
       God’s	 **ability** of	deliver	them	if	He	so	chose.
    b. Daniel	3:17b	– ... _and	He	will	deliver	us	out	of	your	hand,	O	king_ .	Whatever	the	outcome,	
       these	three	young	men	knew	they	would	be	delivered.	If	they	died,	they	would	go	to	
       **live** with	God	forever.	If	they	lived,	they	would	be	delivered	physically	here	on	earth.
    c. The	theology	in	this	verse	is	awesome.	You	can	fully	trust	God	while	totally	accepting	
       any	outcome.	They	would	honor	God	whether	or	not	they	lived.	When	God’s	people	die,	
       it	is	the	ultimate	 **upgrade** and	the	essence	of	total	freedom.
8. Daniel	3:18	– _But	even	if	He	does	not,	let	it	be	known	to	you,	O	king,	that	we	are	not	going	_
    _to	serve	your	gods	or	worship	the	golden	image	that	you	have	set	up._ Their	 **faith** in	God	gave	
    them	courage	to	face	death	rather	than	bow	to	idolatry.	Exodus	20:4- 5	
9. About	this	time	in	the	study	the	question	often	arises	concerning	the	whereabouts	of	
    **Daniel** .	Why	wasn’t	he	standing	firm	against	the	statue	and	the	idol	worship	it	represented?
    a. Since	Daniel	 **wrote** this	chapter,	we	know	he	did	not	bow	to	the	image or	he	would	have	
       mentioned	it.
    b. The	last	time	we	saw	Daniel	was	in	Daniel	2:49	where	he	was	appointed	to	serve	in	the	
       king’s	 **court** .	At	the	time	of	this	event,	he	was	very	likely	serving	in	the	palace	or	on	
       business	for	the	king.





**D. A	brief	analysis	of	the	crisis	in	Daniel	3**

1. In	the	 _times	of	the	Gentiles_ (in	which	we	also	presently	live)	these	youths	expressed	an	
    exemplary	 **response** to	hostility	from	a	pagan	government.
2. They	refused	to	take	the	king’s	edict	as	a personal	affront	or	 **debate** the	issue	of	idolatry.	
    Sometimes	it	impossible	to	adequately	explain	your	reasons	for	noncooperation	to	those	
    who	oppose	the	biblical	worldview.
3. Despite	the	threat	of	death	from	a	hostile	government,	they	followed	God’s	written	word.	
    This	is	a	powerful	example	for	us	to	not	 **panic** but	rather	hold	firmly	to	the	truth	of	God’s	
    written	word.	Ephesians	6:14
4. **Resting** in	what	they	knew	about	God’s	character,	they	entrusted	the	outcome	into	His	
    hands.	They	understood	that	God	does	not	always	deliver	the	faithful	from	martyrdom,	but	
    He	does	do	all	things	well.	They	had	the	attitude	of	Jesus:	“ _not	my	will	but	thine	be	done_ .”	
    Psalm	9:10,	Luke	22:42,	Hebrews	11:36- 37
5. Miracles	were	rare	in	the	Old	Testament;	nevertheless;	these	three	youths	stood	firm	in	
    their	faith,	not	demanding	a	miraculous	deliverance	or	even	particularly	expecting	one.	
    They	simply	desired	God’s	will	regardless	of	the	 **outcome** and	publically	gave	Him	glory.
6. Their	stand	was	a	rebuke	to	the	king’s	arrogance	and	was	a	 **public** declaration	that	only	
    Yahweh	has	ultimate	authority	over	death.
7. This	is	not	just	a	kid’s	story.	This	chapter	is	a	complex	set	of	events	that	unfolded	in	 **history**
    just	as	they	were	recorded	by	Daniel.
8. These	events	reveal	a	 **satanic** plan	for	Israel’s	destruction.	If	this	diabolic	plan	had	worked,	
    all	Jews	would	have	either	converted	to	idolatry	or	faced	death	by	fire.
9. In	the	book	of	Daniel,	we	see	how	God	preserved	a	remnant	of	Israel	in	the	heart	of	
    Babylon,	Satan’s	crown	jewel.	Even	though	many	in	Israel	had	apostatized	through	idolatry,	
    God	was	nonetheless	preserving	a	 **remnant** of	believing	Israel.
10. In	history,	during	the _times	of	the	Gentiles_ , God	was,	and	is,	working	to	move	the	world	
    toward	a	definite	conclusion.	He	is	demonstrating	to	Satan	and	the	sinful	nations	of	earth	
    how	man’s	rule	is	flawed	and	who	ultimately	deserves	to	 **reign**.

**E. Daniel	3:19- 30	 – The	king’s	attitude	darkened.	God	will	use	the	fiery	furnace	**

**miracle	as	a	steppingstone	in	Nebuchadnezzar	journey	to	faith.**

1. Daniel	3:19	– _Then	Nebuchadnezzar	was	filled	with	wrath,	and	his	_ **_facial_** _expression	was	_
    _altered...	He	answered	by	giving	orders	to	heat	the	furnace	seven	times	more	than	it	was_
    _usually	heated_.
    a. When	faced	with	young	believers	willing	to	 **die** rather	than	betray	Almighty	God,	
       Nebuchadnezzar’s	anger	blinded	him	and	he	reacted	foolishly.	James	1:20
    b. Heating	the	furnace	seven	times	hotter	than	normal	would	not	increase	the	suffering	of	
       these	three	Jewish	men;	it	would	mercifully	 **kill** them	instantly.






c. Because	of	his	fury,	Nebuchadnezzar	was	going	to	lose	some	of	his	most	courageous	
soldiers.
d. Also,	his	anger	could	have	inadvertently	opened	the	door	for	rebellion.	Leaders	from	his	
entire	kingdom	were	about	to	witness	three	men	 defy the	king	and	live.

2. Daniel	3:20	– _He	commanded	certain	valiant	warriors	who	were	in	his	army	to	tie	up	_
    _Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego	in	order	to	cast	them	into	the	furnace	of	blazing	fire_ .	The	
    king	had	asked,	“ _What	god	is	there	who	can	deliver	you	out	of	my	hands_ ?	He	was	about	to	
    get	his	 **answer**.
3. Daniel	3:21	– _Then	these	men	were	tied	up	in	their	trousers,	their	coats, their	caps	and	their	_
    _other	clothes,	and	were	cast	into	the	midst	of	the	furnace	of	blazing	fire_ .	As	an	extra	
    safeguard,	the	soldiers	 **bound** the	men	up.
    a. You	can	see	the	pagan	mind	at	work,	believing	they	could	fight	against	God	and	 **win** .	To	
       ensure	the	men	could	not	get	away,	they	tied	them	up.	There	was	no	escape	from	the	
       strong	soldiers	now.
    b. The	three	men	were	completely	helpless	to	 **save** themselves,	but	Yahweh	was	
       completely	able	to	not	only	save	them	 **from** the	fire,	but	also	 **through** the	fire.	Jeremiah	
       32:17,	27
4. Daniel	3:22	– _For	this	reason,	because	the	king’s	command	was	urgent	and	the	furnace	had	_
    _been	made	extremely	hot,	the	flame	of	the	fire	slew	those	men	who	carried	up	Shadrach,	_
    _Meshach	and	Abed-nego_ .	Ironically,	the	 **soldiers** who	carried	out	the	execution	were	
    themselves	killed	by	the	flames.
5. Daniel	3:23	– _But	these	three	men,	Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego,	fell	into	the	midst	of	_
    _the	furnace	of	blazing	fire	still	tied	up_ .	This	may	have	seemed	like	the	doom	of	these	three	
    young	believers.	Bound	they	fell	down	into	the	heat	and	 **flames** of	the	furnace.	Normally	
    this	would	mean	instant	death.
6. Daniel	3:24	– _Then	Nebuchadnezzar	the	king	was	astounded	and	stood	up	in	haste;	he	said	_
    _to	his	high	officials,	“Was	it	not	three	men	we	cast	bound	into	the	midst	of	the	fire?”	They	_
    _replied	to	the	king,	“Certainly,	O	king.”_ King	Nebuchadnezzar	was	 **shocked** .	He	saw	the	three	
    men	unharmed,	moving	about	in	the	furnace.	Isaiah	43:2
7. Daniel	3:25	– _He	said,	“Look!	I	see	four	men	loosed	and	walking	about	in	the	midst	of	the	fire	_
    _without	harm,	and	the	appearance	of	the	fourth	is	like	a	_ **_son_** _of	the	gods!”_
    a. The	king	marveled	at	the	unique	nature	of	the	fourth	 **person**.
    b. From	the	New	Testament	perspective,	we	would	identify	this	person	as	the	pre-
       incarnate	Lord	 **Jesus** Christ	(Christophany).	John	1:16- 18
8. Daniel	3:26a	– _Then	Nebuchadnezzar	came	near	to	the	door	of	the	furnace	of	blazing	fire;	he	_
    _responded	and	said,	“Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego,	come	out,	you	servants	of	the	_
    _Most	High	God,	and	_ **_come_** _here!”_
    a. The	king	approached	the	furnace	and	 **called** them	to	come	out.






b. He	publically	acknowledged	their	loyalty	to	the	 highest God	of	all.	Psalm	83:	18;	Daniel	
4:2,	5:18,	21

9. Daniel	3:26b	– _Then	Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego	came	out	of	the	midst	of	the	fire_ .	
    This	would	have	shocked	every	person	present.	There	would	have	been	gasps	and	total	
    amazement	as	they	emerged	from	the	 **flames** of	the	kiln.
10. Daniel	3:27a	– _The	satraps,	the	prefects,	the	governors	and	the	king’s	high	officials	gathered	_
    _around	and	saw	in	regard	to	these	men..._ All	the	dignitaries	from	all	provinces	gathered	as	
    eyewitnesses	of	this	deliverance.	God	just	made	a	powerful	 **statement**.
11. Daniel	3:27b	– ... _that	the	fire	had	no	effect	on	the	bodies	of	these	men	nor	was	the	hair	of	_
    _their	head	singed,	nor	were	their	trousers	damaged,	nor	had	the	smell	of	fire	even	come	_
    _upon	them_ .	As	impossible	as	it	seems,	God’s	servants	were	totally	 **unharmed**.
12. Daniel	3:28a	– _Nebuchadnezzar	responded	and	said,	“Blessed	be	the	God	of	Shadrach,	_
    _Meshach	and	Abed-nego,	who	has	sent	His	angel	and	delivered	His	servants	who	put	their	_
    _trust	in	Him..._ Nebuchadnezzar	praised	God	and	the	commended	the	 **faith** of	the	youths.
13. Daniel	3:28b	– ... _violating	the	king’s	command,	and	yielded	up	their	bodies	so	as	not	to	serve	_
    _or	worship	any	god	except	their	own	God_ .	The	king	praised	the	men	for	disobeying	him	in	
    order	to	 **obey** their	God.	Nebuchadnezzar	still	did	not	believe	in	God	for	salvation,	but	our	
    gracious	God	was	closely	working	with	him	to	show	him	his	need.
14. Daniel	3:29a	– _Therefore	I	make	a	decree	that	any	people,	nation	or	tongue	that	speaks	_
    _anything	offensive	against	the	God	of	Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego	shall	be	torn	limb	_
    _from	limb	and	their	houses	reduced	to	a	rubbish	heap..._ By	means	of	this	event,	the	Jewish	
    religion	gained	special	 **status** throughout	the	entire	realm.
15. Daniel	3:29b	– _...inasmuch	as	there	is	no	other	god	who	is	able	to	deliver	in	this	way_ .	Soon	
    thousands	of	Jews	would	be	exiled	to	Babylon	from	Judah	and	Jerusalem.	This	decree	would	
    safeguard	their	 **freedom** to	worship	Yahweh,	all	thanks	to	the	faith	of	three	Jewish	youth	
    who	refused	to	compromise	even	in	the	face	of	death.
    a. Satan	and	his	minions	lost	a	victory.	Nebuchadnezzar’s	 **decree** would	prove	to	be	a	
       blessing	for	Israelite	believers	everywhere	in	his	empire.	In	the	midst	of	the	most	
       idolatrous	nation	on	earth,	protection	was	granted	and	guaranteed	to	the	Jewish	people	
       to	worship	their	God,	Yahweh.
    b. Amazingly,	after	70	years	of	suffering,	Israel	emerged	from	Babylon	as	people	of	the	
       Book.	Synagogues,	as	places	of	learning,	flourished	and	Israel	never	again	reverted	to	
       **idolatry** as	a	nation.
16. Daniel	3:30	– _Then	the	king	caused	Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego	to	prosper	in	the	_
    _province	of	Babylon_ .	Although	the	king	responded	by	giving	special	treatment	to	these	men,	
    not	every	story	of those	who	stand	firm	for	their	faith	ends	well.	Believers	are	often	
    **martyred** without	any	miraculous	rescue.
    a. Amazingly,	God	used	all	these	events	as	part	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	spiritual	 **journey**.






1) In	chapter	one,	Nebuchadnezzar	was	amazed	by	the	 superior wisdom	of	the	Jewish	
youths.	Daniel	1:19- 20
2) In	chapter	two,	he	recognized	God’s	unique	power	to	reveal	the	 future through	
Daniel’s	interpretation	of	the	dream.	Nebuchadnezzar	told	Daniel,	“ Surely your	God	
is	a God	of	gods	and	a	Lord	of	kings	and	a revealer	of	mysteries ...”	Daniel	2:47
3) In	chapter	three,	Nebuchadnezzar	saw	God’s	supernatural	ability	to	deliver	people	
from	his	power	and	judgment	and	pronounced,	“ There	is no other	god	who	is	able	
to	deliver	in	this	way .”	Daniel	3:29
4) In	chapter	four,	the	king	will	be	humiliated	and	finally	become	a	 believer in	
Yahweh.

**F. Observations	and	Applications	from	Daniel	three**

1. This	account	reminded	exiled	and	persecuted	Israel	that	Yahweh	sovereignly	 **reigns** over	all.	
    Psalm	92:8,	97:9
2. This	account	reminded	Israel	of	the	 **evils** of	idolatry	and	the	need	to	always	trust	in	Yahweh.	
    Exodus	20:4
3. Idolatry,	or	false	religion	combined	with	government,	easily	leads	to	the	deaths	of	believers.	
    Today	God	commands	all	believers	to	 **pray** for	their	governments	in	order	to	enjoy	freedom	
    to	live	quiet	lives	of	service	to	Him.	1	Timothy	2:1- 2
    a. In	these	 _times	of	the	Gentiles_ we	are	to	 **live** by	faith	just	as	taught	in	the	Word.
       1) Living	by	faith	means	trusting	God	regardless	of	the	 **dangers** of	our	circumstances	
          or	the	consequences	of	God-obedient	actions.	Acts	5:29
       2) When	we	live	by	 **faith** ,	we	are	not	easily	stopped	by	threats,	diverted	by	
          adversaries,	or	dissuaded	by	the	superstitious	opinions	or	actions	of	the	pagan	
          world.	Ephesians	6:10- 17
       3) When	we	live	by	faith,	we	reject	the	urge	to	 **mix** God’s	truth	with	the	pagan	
          worldview.	Romans	12:2,	1	John	2:15- 17
       4) When	we	live	by	faith,	we	understand	that	life	is	temporary	and	only	has	
          **significance** when	we	live	for	the	glory	of	God.	Philippians	1:21
       5) God	always	 **honors** faith,	but	He	does	not	always	miraculously	deliver	from	death.	
          Sometime	believers	are	martyred.	In	those	cases,	believers	are	delivered	from	evil	
          people	by	death.	Philippians	1:22- 23	





**VII. Daniel	4:1- 37	 – Nebuchadnezzar	believes	in	God**

**A. Daniel	4	– A	unique	chapter**

1. Daniel	was	around	50	years	of	age	when	this	was	written.	Drunken	with	the	pride	of	his	
    accomplishments,	Nebuchadnezzar	probably	seemed	 **less** likely	than	ever	to	believe.
    a. Over	the	years,	Nebuchadnezzar	had	transitioned	from	being	a	conqueror	to	becoming	
       a	builder.	Under	his	rule,	Babylon,	the	capital	city,	had	become	an	invincible	 **citadel**.
    b. Nebuchadnezzar	became	content	in	his	arrogance	and	his	 **heart** was	hardened.	
       Nevertheless,	his	world	would	soon	to	be	shaken.
2. Daniel	4	is	an	autobiographical	document	precisely	as	spoken	by	Nebuchadnezzar.	Under	
    the	inspiration	of	the	Holy	Spirit,	Daniel	was	compelled	to	include	this	 **narrative** in	his	
    prophecy.
3. Daniel	4	became	like	a	one	page	 **tract** .	Nebuchadnezzar’s	citizens’	comprehension	of	the	
    true	God	(Yahweh)	and	His	sovereignty	would	greatly	expand	as	a	result	of	this	narrative.
4. The	first	four	chapters	of	Daniel	describe	how	God	progressively	orchestrated	events	in	
    order	to	 **convince** Nebuchadnezzar	of	the	reality	of	his	smallness	before	almighty	God.
    a. The	change	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	thinking	was	 **progressive** .	Twenty-five	years	had	
       passed	since	his	first	introduction	to	Yahweh	through	the	interpretation	of	his	dream	by	
       Daniel.
    b. With	the	passing	of	years,	Nebuchadnezzar	came	to	understand	some	basic	 **truths**
       about	Yahweh,	although	he	had	not	yet	recognized	God	as	the	only	one	to	be	trusted	
       and	worshiped.
5. God	works	tirelessly	to	 **draw** people	to	Himself.
    a. Christ	died	for	 **everyone** in	the	world.	He	does	not	desire	for	anyone	to	perish.	John	
       3:16,	1	Timothy	2:4,	2	Peter	3:9
    b. Through	Creation God	reveals	to	all	mankind	His	unequalled	power	and	 **majesty** .	 _For	_
       _since	the	creation	of	the	world	His	invisible	attributes,	His	eternal	power	and	divine	_
       _nature,	have	been	clearly	seen_ ...	(Rom.	1:20)	Psalm	19:1
    c. On	a	personal	level,	God	the	Holy	Spirit	 **convicts** each	sinner	of	his	unbelief	and	of	God’s	
       righteousness	and	His	judgment	of	sin.	John	16:8- 11
    d. Daniel	could	easily	have	seen	Nebuchadnezzar	as	a	lost	cause,	never	dreaming	he	would	
       ever	humble	himself	and	believe	in	God,	but	during	all	those	years	God	was	at	 **work** ,	
       slowly	chipping	away	at	Nebuchadnezzar’s	heart.	Matthew	19:26,	Romans	2:4,	1	
       Timothy	1:15- 16	





**B. Daniel	4:1- 3	 – Nebuchadnezzar’s	preamble	of	praise**

1. Daniel	4:1	– _Nebuchadnezzar	the	king	to	all	the	peoples,	nations,	and	men	of	every	language	_
    _that	live in	all	the	earth:	“May	your	peace	abound!_ ”	Amazingly,	everyone	in	the	Babylonian	
    Empire	heard	the	following	 **true** story	about	how	God,	the	one	true	God,	had	humbled	their	
    great	king	and	brought	him	to	a	point	of	unpretentious	faith.
2. Daniel	4:2	– _It	has	seemed	good	to	me	to	declare	the	signs	and	wonders	which	the	Most	_
    _High	God	has	done	for	me_ .	Through	these	miracles,	Nebuchadnezzar	learned	not	only	God’s	
    power	but	also	God’s	concern	and	 **love** specifically	for	him.	At	the	same	time,	God	used	
    these	miracles	to	show	Himself	to	all	who	heard	about	them.
3. Daniel	4:3	– _How	great	are	His	signs	and	how	mighty	are	His	wonders!	His	kingdom	is	an	_
    _everlasting	kingdom	and	His	dominion	is	from	generation	to	generation_ .	Nebuchadnezzar’s	
    praise	reflected	his	changed	 **thinking** about	God	and	God’s	ultimate	and	absolute	authority	
    over	all	creation	and	every	nation.

**C. Daniel	4:4- 18	 – The	chronicle	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream**

1. Daniel	4:4	– _I,	Nebuchadnezzar,	was	at	ease	in	my	house	and	flourishing	in	my	palace_ .	
    Nebuchadnezzar	got	to	a	point	where	he	had	very	little	external	pressure.	Once	again,	two	
    similar	words	side	by	side	 _ease_ SHELEH,	meaning	contented;	and	 _flourishing_ RA’ANAN,	
    meaning	prosperous,	(literally	green	or	alive)	emphasize	the	 **peace** the	king	enjoyed.
2. Daniel	4:5	– _I	saw	a	dream	and	it	made	me	fearful;	and	these	fantasies	as	I	lay	on	my	bed	_
    _and	the	visions	in	my	mind	kept	alarming	me_ .	The	dream	terrified	Nebuchadnezzar,	
    prompting	him	to	seek	help.	Predictably,	he	sought	 **help** in	the	wrong	places,	the	wise	men	
    of	Babylon.
3. Daniel	4:6	– _So	I	gave	orders	to	bring	into	my	presence	all	the	wise	men	of	Babylon,	that	_
    _they	might	make	known	to	me	the	interpretation	of	the	dream_ .	Nebuchadnezzar’s	desire	to	
    understand	his	recurring	dream	gave	Daniel	an	opportunity	to	show	him	God's	 **superior**
    wisdom.
4. Daniel	4:7	– _Then	the	magicians,	the	conjurers,	the	Chaldeans	and	the	diviners	came	in	and	I	_
    _related	the	dream	to	them,	but	they	could	not	make	its	interpretation	known	to	me_ .	Once	
    again,	the	 **best** minds	in	the	kingdom	could	not	explain	the	king’s	dream.	Human	reasoning	
    was	bankrupt.	Only	God	could	help.
5. Daniel	4:8	– _But	finally	Daniel	came	in	before	me,	whose	name	is	Belteshazzar	according	to	_
    _the	name	of	my	god,	and	in	whom	is	a	spirit	of	the	holy	gods;	and	I	related	the	dream	to	_
    _him..._ Nebuchadnezzar	eventually	consulted	Daniel,	referring	to	him	by	his	Hebrew	 **name** ,	
    Daniel.	He	expressed	Daniel’s	spiritual	superiority	in	a	way	understandable	to	people	with	a	
    polytheistic	worldview.
6. Daniel	4:9	– _O	Belteshazzar,	chief	of	the	magicians,	since	I	know	that	a	spirit	of	the	holy	gods	_
    _is	in	you	and	no	mystery	baffles	you,	tell	me	the	visions	of	my	dream	which	I	have	seen,	_
    _along	with	its	interpretation_ .	The	king	had	not	yet	 **believed** in	God.	He	referred	once	more	
    to	Daniel	as	 _Belteshazzar_ and	as	having	 _a	spirit	of	the	holy	gods_.





7. Daniel	4:10	– _Now	these	were	the	visions	in	my	mind	as	I	lay	on	my	bed:	I	was	looking,	and	_
    _behold,	there	was	a	tree	in	the	midst	of	the	earth	and	its	height	was	great_ .	Nebuchadnezzar	
    described	an	enormous	 **tree** .	This	was	the	key	component	of	his	dream.
    a. In	Scripture,	trees	are	sometimes	used	to	represented	individuals	or	 **kingdoms** .	Psalm	
       1:3,	Ezekiel	31:2-14,	Matthew	13:31- 32
    b. Likewise,	in	the	ancient	literature,	monarchs	were	sometimes	described	as	trees.	We	
       will	see	that	this	tree	unquestionably	symbolized	Nebuchadnezzar	and	his	 **reign** .	Daniel	
       4:22
8. Daniel	4:11	– _The	tree grew	large	and	became	strong,	and	its	height	reached	to	the	sky,	and	_
    _it	was	visible	to	the	end	of	the	whole	earth_ .	In	the	book	of	Daniel,	Nebuchadnezzar	was	
    described	both	as	a	tree	and	a	head	of	gold.	As	he	had	increased	in	 **power** so	had	his	
    kingdom.
9. Daniel	4:12	– _Its	foliage	was	beautiful	and	its	fruit	abundant,	and	in	it	was	food	for	all.	The	_
    _beasts	of	the	field	found	shade	under	it,	and	the	birds	of	the	sky	dwelt	in	its	branches,	and	all	_
    _living	creatures	fed	themselves	from	it_ .	Nebuchadnezzar’s	magnificent	and	prosperous	
    kingdom	 **provided** food	and	protection	for	all	who	lived	within	its	extensive	borders.
10. Daniel	4:13	– _I	was	looking	in	the	visions	in	my	mind	as	I	lay	on	my	bed,	and	behold,	an	_
    _angelic	watcher,	a	holy	one,	descended	from	heaven_ .	Later	(Dan.	4:23),	Daniel	will	identify	
    the	watcher	as	a	divine	 **informant** .	Perhaps	he	was	like	one	of	the	angelic	beings	who	patrol	
    the earth	as	seen	in	Zechariah	1:9-11.
11. Daniel	4:14	– _He	shouted	out	and	spoke	as	follows:	“Chop	down	the	tree	and	cut	off	its	_
    _branches,	strip	off	its	foliage	and	scatter	its	fruit;	Let	the	beasts	flee	from	under	it	and	the	_
    _birds	from	its	branches_ .	If	the	tree were	 **cut** down,	the	birds	and	beasts	would	lose	their	
    place	of	protection	and	feeding.	This	of	course,	would	be	disastrous	for	these	animals.
12. Daniel	4:15a	– _Yet	leave	the	stump	with	its	roots	in	the	ground,	but	with	a	band	of	iron	and	_
    _bronze	around	it,	in	the	new	grass	of	the	field_ ...	Leaving	the	stump	meant	the	tree	could	
    possibly	live	again.	While	the	iron	band	might	protect	the	 **stump** ,	giving	it	stability,	it	would	
    also	limit	future	expansion	and	development.
13. Daniel	4:15b	– ... _and	let	him	be	drenched	with	the dew	of	heaven,	and	let	him	share	with	the	_
    _beasts	in	the	grass	of	the	earth_ .	Jumping	forward,	we	know	Nebuchadnezzar	was	going	to	
    be	stricken	with	a	severe	form	of	lycanthropy,	a **disease** that	causes	the	sufferer	to	think	he	
    or	she	is	an	animal.
14. Daniel	4:16 – _Let	his	mind	be	changed	from	that	of	a	man	and	let	a	beast’s	mind	be	given	to	_
    _him,	and	let	seven	periods	of	time	pass	over	him_ .	The	dream	showed	that	the	effects	of	this	
    would	last	for	seven	periods	of	time,	which	in	this	case	equaled	seven	 **years**.





15. Daniel	4:17	– _This	sentence	is	by	the	decree	of	the	angelic	watchers,	and	the	decision	is	a	_
    _command	of	the	holy	ones,	in	order	that	the	living	may	know,	that	the	Most	High	is	ruler	_
    _over	the	realm	of	mankind,	and	bestows	it	on	whom	He	wishes,	and	sets	over	it	the	lowliest	_
    _of	men_ .	There	was	an	important	 **lesson** to	learn	from	this	event.
    a. This	 **event** was	not	going	to	teach	a	lesson	to	King	Nebuchadnezzar	alone.
    b. The	angelic	watcher	said	this	was	going	to	happen	so	that	 _the	living_ ,	or	everyone	alive,	
       would	learn	that	God	alone	has	sovereign	authority	over	men	and	nations.	Through	this	
       event,	God	wanted	to	work	a	spiritual	 **revival** in	the	entire	Babylonian	empire.
16. Daniel	4:18a	– _This	is	the	dream	which	I,	King	Nebuchadnezzar,	have	seen._ Unlike	his	first	
    dream,	Nebuchadnezzar	carefully	explained	his	dream	in	great	 **detail** .	The	wise	men	of	his	
    kingdom	had	every	opportunity	to	confer	with	their	gods	and	seek	their	help.	No	help	came.
17. Daniel	4:18b	– _Now	you,	Belteshazzar,	tell	me	its	interpretation,	inasmuch	as	none	of	the	_
    _wise	men	of	my	kingdom	is	able	to	make	known	to	me	the	interpretation;	but	you	are	able,	_
    _for	a	spirit	of	the	holy	gods	is	in	you._ The	king	acknowledged	that	the	wise	men	of	Babylon
    could	not	 **interpret** his	dream,	but	he	knew	Daniel	could.

**D. Daniel	4:19- 27	 – The	interpretation	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream**

1. Daniel	4:19a	– _Then	Daniel,	whose	name	is	Belteshazzar,	was	appalled	for	a	while	as	his	_
    _thoughts	alarmed	him.	The	king	responded	and	said,	“Belteshazzar,	do	not	let	the	dream	or	_
    _its	interpretation	alarm	you.”_ God’s	message	through	the	dream	deeply	distressed	Daniel,	
    but	the	king	reassured	him.	God’s	projections	are	not	always	 **cheerful**.
2. Daniel	4:19b	– _Belteshazzar	replied,	“My	lord,	if	only	the	dream	applied	to	those	who	hate	_
    _you	and	its	interpretation	to	your	adversaries!”_ Even	though	the	ominous	predictions	made	
    him	fear	for	the	king,	Daniel	very	sensitively	told	Nebuchadnezzar	the	 **bad** news.
3. Daniel	4:20	– _The	tree	that	you	saw,	which	became	large	and	grew	strong,	whose	height	_
    _reached	to	the	sky	and	was	visible	to	all	the	earth_ ...	As	Nebuchadnezzar	grew	stronger,	he	
    also	grew	increasingly	arrogant.	His	 **pride** would	be	his	own	undoing.
4. Daniel	4:21	– ... _and	whose	foliage	was	beautiful	and	its	fruit	abundant,	and	in	which	was	_
    _food	for	all,	under	which	the	beasts	of	the	field	dwelt	and	in	whose	branches	the	birds	of	the	_
    _sky	lodged..._ The	dream	showed	that	Nebuchadnezzar’s	kingdom	had	indeed	become	a	
    **refuge** for	many	peoples.	This	blessing	should	have	made	the	king	humble	and	caring	rather	
    than	proud.
5. Daniel	4:22	– ... _it	is	you,	O	king;	for	you	have	become	great	and	grown	strong,	and	your	_
    _majesty	has	become	great	and	reached	to	the	sky	and	your	dominion	to	the	end	of	the	_
    _earth_ .	This	verse	describes	Nebuchadnezzar’s	influence	like	that	of	an	overarching	tree	
    whose	branches	 **extend** far	and	wide,	giving	abundant	food	to	all	under	its	shadow.
6. Daniel	4:23a	– _In	that	the	king	saw	an	angelic	watcher,	a	holy	one,	descending	from	heaven	_
    The	Babylonian	word	 _watcher_ was	as	word	that	was	used	of	government	informants	whose	
    job	was	to	covertly	gather	information	throughout	the	kingdom.	In	this	case,	the	angelic	
    **watcher** demanded	(Dan	4:14)	that	Nebuchadnezzar	be	cut	down.





7. Daniel	4:23b	– _...and	saying,	“Chop	down	the	tree	and	destroy	it;	yet	leave	the	stump	with	its	_
    _roots	in	the	ground,	but	with	a	band	of	iron	and	bronze	around	it	in	the	new	grass	of	the	_
    _field...”	_ This	judgment	was	so that	everyone	would	know	(Dan	4:17)	that	God	alone	 **reigns** ,	
    installing	kings	and	kingdoms	as	he	considers	best.	He	often	raises	up	the	least	likely	men.	1	
    Samuel	2:8;	Psalm	83:18,	103:19;	Romans	13:1
8. Daniel	4:23c	– _“...and	let	him	be	drenched	with	the	dew	of	heaven	and	let	him	share	with	the	_
    _beasts	of	the	field	until seven	periods	of	time	pass	over	him_ .”	The	seven	periods	of	time	
    mentioned	here	turned	out	to	be	seven	years.	This	detail	will	be	 **helpful** in	interpreting	
    Daniel	9.
9. Daniel	4:24	– ... _this	is	the	interpretation,	O	king,	and	this	is	the	decree	of	the	Most	High,	_
    _which	has	come	upon	my	lord	the	king_ .	God	is	the	highest	authority.	His	 **authority** is	
    infinitely	greater	than	the	temporary	political	influence	He	grants	to	kings.	Psalm	83:18
10. Daniel	4:25a	– Daniel	clarified	what	would	happen.	Nebuchadnezzar	would	 _...be	driven	_
    _away	from	mankind	and	_ [his]	 _dwelling	place	be	with	the	beasts	of	the	field,	and	_ [he	would]	
    _be	given	grass	to	eat	like	cattle	and	be	drenched	with	the	dew	of	heaven..._ This	was	a	
    **gloomy** warning	that	must	have	pained	Daniel	to	communicate	to	the	emperor.
11. Daniel	4:25b	– _...and	seven	periods	of	time	will	pass	over	you,	until	you	recognize	that	the	_
    _Most	High	is	ruler	over	the	realm	of	mankind	and	bestows	it	on	whomever	He	wishes..._ God	
    had	a	very	specific	lesson	he	wanted	to	teach	Nebuchadnezzar.	The	lesson	was	that God,	
    not	Nebuchadnezzar	or	any	other	man,	rules	 **supreme** over	all	the	earth.
12. Daniel	4:26	– _And	in	that	it	was	commanded	to	leave	the	stump	with	the	roots	of	the	tree,	_
    _your	kingdom	will	be	assured	to	you	after	you	recognize	that	it	is	Heaven	that	rules_ .	God
    decreed	that	Nebuchadnezzar	would	suffer	a	seven-year	judgment,	but	He	gave	him	a	
    promise	of	restoration	when he	would	finally	accept	God	as	the	one	and	 **only** sovereign.
13. Daniel	4:27	– _Therefore,	O	king,	may	my	advice	be	pleasing	to	you:	break	away	now	from_
    _your	sins	by	doing	righteousness	and	from	your	iniquities	by	showing	mercy	to	the	poor,	in	_
    _case	there	may	be	a	prolonging	of	your	prosperity_ .	Daniel	spoke	the	truth	in	love	to	his	king.	
    He	gave	him	the	 **best** advice	possible.
    a. Daniel	 **pled** with	Nebuchadnezzar to	flee	from	a	life	of	sin	and	to	live	righteously.	He	
       gave	him	a	practical	example	of	this	by	commanding	him	to	treat	the	poor	with	
       compassion.
    b. Daniel	was	careful	not	to	promise	Nebuchadnezzar	that	God	would	withhold	judgment	
       from	him.	But	he	did	promise an	extension	to	the	period	of	his	prosperity	if	he	changed	
       his	heart	and	departed	from	his	 **evil** ways.

**E. Daniel	4:28- 33	 – The	fulfillment	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream**

1. Daniel	4:28	– _All	this	happened	to	Nebuchadnezzar	the	king_ .	In	the	ancient	literary	style,	this	
    verse	gives	a	quick	summary	statement	with	the	ensuing	verses	filling	out	the	details.	God	
    graciously	gave	Nebuchadnezzar	twelve	months	to	 **change** his	mind,	but	instead he	
    maintained	his	arrogance.





2. Daniel	4:29	– _Twelve	months	later	he	was	walking	on	the	roof	of	the	royal	palace	of	_
    _Babylon_ .	Because	of	his	triumphs	and	the	supremacy	of	Babylon,	Nebuchadnezzar	
    continued	to	arrogantly	take	credit	for	what	God	alone	had	 **granted**.
3. Daniel	4:30	– _The	king	reflected	and	said,	“Is	this	not	Babylon	the	great,	which	I	myself	have	_
    _built	as	a	royal	residence	by	the	might	of	my	power	and	for	the	glory	of	my	majesty?”_ The	
    greatness	of	Babylon	is	no	 **secret** ,	being	confirmed	by	both	historical	writings	and	
    archaeological	findings.
    a. The	city	of	Babylon	was	surrounded	by	 8 - meters-thick	( 25 - foot-thick) walls	that	were	
       **decorated** with	enameled	bricks.	The	walls	had	260	towers,	each	spaced	50	meters	( 160	
       feet) apart.	A	seven-story	temple	mound	towered	above	the	city.
    b. Though	disputed	by	some	modern	historians,	the	city	of	Babylon	was	said	to	have	
       housed	hanging	 **gardens** ,	which	were	considered	to	be	one	of	the	seven	wonders	of	the	
       ancient	world.	Designing	these	gardens	would	have	been	an	amazing	architectural	
       accomplishment.
4. Daniel	4:31	– _While	the	word was	in	the	king’s	mouth,	a	voice	came	from	heaven,	saying,	_
    _“King	Nebuchadnezzar,	to	you	it	is	declared:	sovereignty	has	been	removed	from	you...”_ God	
    removed	Nebuchadnezzar’s	ruling	authority	because	he	arrogantly	took	 **credit** for	being	the	
    mastermind	behind Babylon’s	majesty	and	greatness.
    a. Who	ruled	in	Nebuchadnezzar’s	absence?	Could	it	have	been	Daniel,	a	high-ranking
       authority	in	the	king’s	 **court** ,	along	with	his	three	Hebrew	friends	who	governed	the	
       province	of	Babylon?	Daniel	2:49,	3:12
    b. Historically,	in	moments	like	these,	a	debilitated	dictator	would	be	immediately	killed.	
       Because	of	his	weakness,	even	Satan	might	have	wanted	to	see	him	replaced,	but	in	
       spite	of	all	this	and	against	amazing	odds,	no	one	took	Nebuchadnezzar’s	 **place**.
5. Daniel	4:32a	– ... _and	you will	be	driven	away	from	mankind,	and	your	dwelling	place	will	be	_
    _with	the	beasts	of	the	field.	You	will	be	given	grass	to	eat	like	cattle,	and	seven	periods	of	_
    _time	will	pass	over	you...	_ Nebuchadnezzar	had	trusted	his	 **own** genius	to	provide	security	
    and	power,	but	God	showed	him	the	falseness	of	his	security,	taking	it	all	away.
6. Daniel	4:32b	– ... _until	you	recognize	that	the	Most	High	is	ruler	over	the	realm	of	mankind	_
    _and	bestows	it	on	whomever	He	wishes_ .	God's	purpose	for	this	judgment	now	becomes	
    **clearer**.
    a. Nebuchadnezzar	needed	to	change	his	mind	about	God’s	 **supremacy**.
    b. He	needed	to	understand	that	his	achievements	were	only	possible	because	God	
       **allowed** him	to	succeed.
7. Daniel	4:33	– _Immediately	the	word	concerning	Nebuchadnezzar	was	fulfilled;	and	he	was	_
    _driven	away	from	mankind	and	began	eating	grass	like	cattle,	and	his	body	was	drenched	_
    _with	the	dew	of	heaven	until	his	hair	had	grown	like	eagles’	feathers	and	his	nails	like	birds’	_
    _claws_ .	God’s	prophetic	word	was	fulfilled	and	Nebuchadnezzar	became	a	wild	 **animal**.





**F. Daniel	4:34- 37	 – Nebuchadnezzar	praised	God**

1. Daniel	4:34a	– _But	at	the	end	of	that	period,	I,	Nebuchadnezzar,	raised	my	eyes	toward	_
    _heaven	and	my	reason	returned	to	me..._ Finally,	in	a	fragile	act	of	faith,	Nebuchadnezzar	
    humbly	 **looked** up	to	the	sovereign	God	of	the	universe.	Psalm	138:6;	James	4:6,	8
    a. God	immediately	responded	with	grace	toward	the	king’s	faith	and	restored	his	 **mind**.
    b. The	king	sanity	returned	and	he	broke	forth	in	 **praise** to	the	Most	High	God.
2. Daniel	4:34b	– _...and	my	reason	returned	to	me,	and	I	blessed	the	Most	High	and	praised	and	_
    _honored	Him	who	lives	forever;	for	His	dominion	is	an	everlasting	dominion,	and	His	_
    _kingdom	endures	from	generation	to	generation_ .	Nebuchadnezzar’s	restoration	after	seven	
    long	years	of	being	like	an	animal,	fulfilled	his	 **prophetic** dream.
    a. In	Daniel	4:30	the	king	had	said,	 _“Is	this	not	Babylon	the	great,	which	I	_ **_myself_** _have	built	_
       _as	a	royal	residence	by	the	might	of	my	power	and	for	the	glory	of	my	majesty?”_
    b. The	superior	words	he	previously	applied	to	himself,	he	now	aptly	 **applied** to	God.
    c. Pride	ultimately	makes	a	person	believe	he	or	she	is	a	demigod.	Probably	one	of	the	
       biggest	deterrents	to	pride	is	gaining	an	understanding	of	God’s	 **greatness** and	realizing	
       that	our	gifts	and	abilities	come	only	from	God’s	grace.	1	Chronicles	29:11,	1	Corinthians	
       4:7,	1	Peter	5:6
    d. God	 **resists** the	proud;	he	does	not	come	to	their	aid.	Psalm	101:5,	138:6;	1	Peter	5:5
3. Daniel	4:35	– _All	the	inhabitants	of	the	earth	are	accounted	as	nothing,	but	He	does	_
    _according	to	His	will	in	the	host	of	heaven	and	among	the	inhabitants	of	earth;	and	no	one	_
    _can	ward	off	His	hand	or	say	to	Him,	“What	have	You	done”_ Nebuchadnezzar’s	new	
    understanding	of	God's	 **character** now	brought	him to	an	accurate	view	of	mankind.
4. Daniel	4:36	– Afterward,	by	God’s	 **grace** ,	Nebuchadnezzar	once	again	ruled	Babylon.	 _At	that	_
    _time,	my	reason	returned	to	me.	And	my	majesty	and	splendor	were	restored	to	me	for	the	_
    _glory	of	my	kingdom,	and	my	counselors	and	my nobles	began	seeking	me	out;	so,	I	was	_
    _reestablished	in	my	sovereignty,	and	surpassing	greatness	was	added	to	me_.
5. Daniel	4:37	– _Now	I,	Nebuchadnezzar,	praise,	exalt	and	honor	the	King	of	heaven,	for	all	His	_
    _works	are	true	and	His	ways	just,	and	He	is	able to	humble	those	who	walk	in	pride_ .	The	king	
    did	not	force	his	faith	on	his	people.	He	simply	praised	and	 **honored** God	before	them.	
    Would	his	citizens	believe	in	God	or	not?





**VIII. Daniel	5:1- 31	 – The	Fall	of	Babylon**

**A. The	royal	family	of	Babylon**

1. Nabopolassar,	Nebuchadnezzar's	father,	ruled	the	emerging	Neo-Babylonian	Empire	from	
    626	to	605	BC.	Nebuchadnezzar	served	as	his	military	 **general** and	chief	administrator.
2. Nebuchadnezzar	became	king	after	his	father’s	death.	He	was	the	mastermind	of	Babylon’s	
    greatest	conquests and	rise	to	 **world** domination.	He	ruled	from	605	to	562	BC.
3. After	Nebuchadnezzar’s	death,	his	son	Amel-Marduk	ruled	Babylon.	His	rule	from	562	to	
    560	BC	was	short-lived.	He	was	a	 **weak** and	immoral	ruler.	Neriglisar,	one	of	
    Nebuchadnezzar’s	sons-in-law,	is	said	to	have	assassinated	and	replaced	him.
4. Neriglisar	ruled	Babylon	for	four	years,	from	560	to	556	BC.	He	is	said	to	have	died	of	
    **natural** causes.
5. After	Neriglisar,	his	son,	Labashi-Marduk,	ruled	Babylon	for	about	nine	months.	He	was	
    deemed	too	 **young** to	rule	and	was	assassinated.
6. After	the	death	of	Labashi-Marduk,	Nabonidus,	another	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	sons-in-law,	
    rose	to	 **power** .	He	ruled	from	556	BC	until	Babylon’s	fall	in	539	BC.
7. Although	Nabonidus	was	the	supreme	king,	because	of	his	archaeological	interests	outside	
    the	city	of	Babylon,	he	allowed	his	son	Belshazzar	to	rule	as	 **king** in	his	place.	Daniel	5:1
    a. Nebuchadnezzar	had	only	been	gone	23	years,	and	yet	a	string	of	 **weak** rulers	had	
       followed	in	his	absence.
    b. At	this	time,	Daniel	had	either	retired	from	public	life	or	been	removed	from	office.	He	
       had	been	in	 **captivity** in	Babylon	for	nearly	66	years.

**B. Daniel	5:1	– The	final	day	of	the	Babylonian	empire**

1. Daniel	5:1a	- _Belshazzar	the	king_ ...	The	chapter	begins	with	Belshazzar	as	 **king**.
    a. For	centuries,	 **critics** of	the	Bible	used	the	lack	of	extra-biblical	historical	information	
       concerning	Belshazzar	to	declare	the	Bible	as	inaccurate.
    b. Their	claim	that	the	book	of	Daniel	gave	false	information	was	finally	disproved	when	
       archaeologists	found	a	clay	tablet	left	by	King	Nabonidus	on	which	he	mentioned	his	son	
       Belshazzar	by	 **name**.
2. Daniel	5:1b	– _Belshazzar	...held	a	great	feast	for	a	thousand	of	his	nobles,	and	he	was	_
    _drinking	wine	in	the	presence	of	the	thousand_ .	This	introduces	to	us	what	was	happening	on	
    the	 **last** day	of	the	Babylonian	empire.
    a. According	to	historians,	King	Cyrus	of	Persia	had	been	encamped	outside	the	city	with	
       his	armies	for	three	months.	But	apparently, Belshazzar	was	not	 **worried** since	the	city	
       was	considered	impenetrable	and	was	said	to	have	housed provisions	that	could	sustain	
       a	23-year	siege.






b. Due	to	the	presence	of	Cyrus’	military,	Babylonian	rulers	from	the	entire	kingdom	had	
sought	refuge	in	Babylon,	where	they	felt	 secure enough	to	assemble	for	a	colossal,	
drinking party.

**C. Daniel	5:2- 9	 – The	message	on	the	wall**

1. Daniel	5:2	– _When	Belshazzar	tasted	the	wine,	he	gave	orders	to	bring	the	gold	and	silver	_
    _vessels	which	Nebuchadnezzar	his	father	had	taken	out	of	the	temple	which	was	in	_
    _Jerusalem,	so	that	the	king	and	his	nobles,	his	wives	and	his	concubines	might	drink	from	_
    _them_ .	We	do	not	know	why	Belshazzar	decided	to	desecrate	these	Jewish	 **temple** objects.
    a. Belshazzar	should	have	known	not	to	blaspheme	God	or	desecrate	His	temple	vessels.	
       For	him	to	have	singled	out	these	vessels	and	ordered	them	brought	out	after	nearly	70	
       years	in	storage	was	unquestionably	 **intentional**.
    b. In	Daniel	4:37,	King	Nebuchadnezzar	had	 **honored** God	saying,	“ _Now	I,	Nebuchadnezzar,	_
       _praise,	exalt	and	honor	the	King	of	heaven,	for	all	His	works	are	true	and	His	ways	just,	_
       _and	He	is	able	to	humble	those	who	walk	in	pride_ .”
    c. In	Daniel	3:29,	Nebuchadnezzar	had	decreed	that	no	one	should	ever	 **offend** the	God	of	
       Israel.	 _“Therefore,	I	make	a	decree	that	any	people,	nation	or	tongue	that	speaks	_
       _anything	offensive	against	the	God	of	Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abed-nego	shall	be	torn	_
       _limb	from	limb	and	their	houses	reduced	to	a	rubbish	heap...”_
    d. It	was	no	trivial	matter	for	Belshazzar	to	desecrate	these	vessels	that	had	been	set	 **apart**
       for	worshipping	the	 _King	of	heaven_ .	Ezra	1:7-11;	2	Chronicles	4:19,	5:1- 5
2. Daniel	5:3	– _Then	they	brought	the	gold	vessels	that	had	been	taken	out	of	the	temple,	the	_
    _house	of	God	which	was	in	Jerusalem;	and	the	king	and	his	nobles,	his	wives	and	his	_
    _concubines	drank	from	them_ .	Belshazzar	could	have	defied	any	god	without	suffering,	but	to	
    have	defied	the	 **Creator** of	the	universe,	the	God	of	Israel,	brought	dreadful	consequences.
3. Daniel	5:4	– _They	drank	the	wine	and	praised	the	gods	of	gold	and	silver,	of	bronze,	iron,	_
    _wood	and	stone_ .	As	they	praised	their	 **false** gods, they	offended	the	true	and	living	God.
    a. Belshazzar	was	 **flirting** with	destruction.	With	his	enemy	encamped	nearby,	he	threw	a	
       party,	got	drunk,	and	committed	sacrilege	against	God	almighty.	The	idols	they	were	
       praising	as	they	drank	had	no	voice,	no	life	or	no	ability	to	rescue	him.
    b. God	allowed	Belshazzar	to	choose	his	own	deadly	course	of	action.	God	is	a	gentleman;	
       He	 **allows** people	to	make	their	own	decisions,	even	though	He	knows	their	sinful	
       actions	will	ultimately	bring	them	calamity.	Proverbs	1:30-32,	14:14
4. Daniel	5:5	– _Suddenly	the	fingers	of	a	man’s	hand	emerged	and	began	writing	opposite	the	_
    _lampstand	on	the	plaster	of	the	wall	of	the	king’s	palace,	and	the	king	saw	the	back	of	the	_
    _hand	that	did	the	writing_ .	God	took	up	Belshazzar’s	 **challenge** and	interrupted	the	party.
    a. The	word	 _suddenly_ SHA’AH	(immediately)	emphasized	that	as	 **soon** as	God	was	defied	
       through	the	blasphemous	desecration	of	the	temple	vessels,	the	fingers	appeared.






b. Shocked	to	the	core,	Belshazzar	observed	with	his	own	 eyes the	back	of	the	hand	that	
wrote	on	the	plaster.	We	are	not	told	how	large	or	small	the	hand	was,	but	it	was	clearly	
viewable	from	where	Belshazzar	sat.

5. Daniel	5:6	– _Then	the	king’s	face	grew	pale	and	his	thoughts	alarmed	him,	and	his	hip	joints	_
    _went	slack	and	his	knees	began	knocking	together_ .	Belshazzar	was	 **terrified**.
    a. The	armies	of	the	Persians	brought	the	king	little	fear,	but	a	disembodied	man’s	 **hand**
       sobered	him	instantly.
    b. Although	Belshazzar	did	not	know	what	the	message	meant,	he	probably	knew	 **who** he	
       had	offended.
    c. The sudden	realization	that	this	sign	was	from	God	is	what	most	likely	made	his	face	
       turn	 **pale** ,	his	knees	knock,	and	his	legs	buckle.
6. Daniel	5:7a	– _The	king	called	aloud	to	bring	in	the	conjurers,	the	Chaldeans	and	the	diviners.	_
    The	king	would	have	gotten	more	help	from	the	court	jesters	than	from	the	magicians,	
    priests,	and	astrologers	he	called	in.	The	writing	on	the	wall	was	a	total	mystery	to	these	
    “wise	men.”	They	had	been	unable	to	help	in	the	past,	and	once	again	they	 **failed**.
7. Daniel	5:7b	– Great	riches	and	promotion	were	offered	to	anyone	who	could	 **interpret** the	
    inscription.	 _The	king	spoke	and	said	to	the	wise	men	of	Babylon,	“Any	man	who	can	read	_
    _this	inscription	and	explain	its	interpretation	to	me	shall	be	clothed	with	purple	and	have	a	_
    _necklace	of	gold	around	his	neck,	and	have	authority	as	third	ruler	in	the	kingdom.”_
8. Daniel	5:8	– _Then	all	the	king’s	wise	men	came	in,	but	they	could	not	read	the	inscription	or	_
    _make	known	its	interpretation	to	the	king_ .	God	had	once	again	stumped	these	minions	of	
    Satan.	When	no	one	could	 **explain** the	message,	all	merriment	ceased.
9. Daniel	5:9	– _Then	King	Belshazzar	was	greatly	alarmed,	his	face	grew	even	paler,	and	his	_
    _nobles	were	perplexed_ .	As	the	different	groups	clustered	to	discuss	the	meaning,	and	one	by	
    one	failed	to	offer	any	explanation,	the	king’s	 **fear** intensified.
    a. This	crisis	illustrated	the	inability	of	these	practitioners	of	the	dark	arts	to	give	any	
       **answers**.
    b. The	book	of	Daniel	records	crisis	after	crisis	in	which	God's	servants	relied	on	God’s	
       faithfulness	to	answer	life’s	perplexities.	Daniel	would	again	be	promoted	to	a	place	of	
       authority	for	something	that	God	did	 **through** him.

**D. Daniel	5:10- 16	 – The	Queen’s	wise	advice**

1. Daniel	5:10	– _The	queen	entered	the	banquet	hall	because	of	the	words	of	the	king	and	his	_
    _nobles;	the	queen	spoke	and	said,	“O	king,	live	forever!	Do	not	let	your	thoughts	alarm	you	_
    _or	your	face	be	pale_ .	The	queen	came	in	to	calm	the	situation	and	give	 **advice**.
    a. It	is	virtually	impossible	to	know	the	actual	identity	of	this	queen.	Some	speculate	she	
       was	Belshazzar’s	mother	(a	daughter	of	Nebuchadnezzar)	or	grandmother	(a	wife	of	
       Nebuchadnezzar).	Either	way	Daniel	referred	to	her	as	 **queen** in	this	passage.






b. The	queen	definitely	 knew Babylon’s	history	and	who	in	the	kingdom	would	be	able	to	
interpret	the	dream.

2. Daniel	5:11a	– _There	is	a	man	in	your	kingdom	in	whom	is	a	spirit	of	the	holy	gods;	and	in	_
    _the	days	of	your	father,	illumination,	insight	and	wisdom	like	the	wisdom	of	the	gods	were	_
    _found	in	him._
    a. The	queen,	of	course,	spoke	of	Daniel	and	how	he	had	interpreted	King	
       Nebuchadnezzar’s	 **dreams** .	Daniel	4:18
    b. Just	as	Nebuchadnezzar	had	done,	she	referred	to	Daniel	in	a	way	 **pagan** people	could	
       understand,	saying	he	had	 _a	spirit	of	the	holy	gods_.
3. Daniel	5:11b	– _And	King	Nebuchadnezzar,	your	father,	your	father	the	king,	appointed	him	_
    _chief	of	the	magicians,	conjurers,	Chaldeans	and	diviners_ .	She	reminded	Belshazzar	that	
    since	Daniel	had	once	managed	all	the	wise	men	of	Babylon,	he	was	 **qualified** to	intervene.
    a. She	told	him	that	his	father	(an	endearing	way	of	referring	to	his	most	important	
       predecessor),	King	Nebuchadnezzar,	had	made	Daniel	 **chief** over	the	sorcerers,	
       enchanters,	astrologers,	and	fortune-tellers	of	Babylon.
    b. This	historical	fact	concerning	Daniel’s	position	of	superiority	had	very	likely	made	him	
       unpopular,	since	he	would	have	 **opposed** the	pagan	worldview	and	practices	of	these	
       religious	sects.
4. Daniel	5:12	– _“This	was	because	an	extraordinary	spirit,	knowledge	and	insight,	_
    _interpretation	of	dreams,	explanation	of	enigmas	and	solving	of	difficult	problems	were	_
    _found	in	this	Daniel,	whom	the	king	named	Belteshazzar.	Let	Daniel	now	be	summoned	and	_
    _he	will	_ **_declare_** _the	interpretation.”_
    a. After	a	lengthy	 **discourse** on	Daniel’s	qualifications,	the	queen	urged	Belshazzar	to	
       summon	him.
    b. It	is	interesting	that	she	used	Daniel’s	Hebrew	 **name** ,	not	his	Babylonian	name.	She	may	
       have	believed	in	God	like	King	Nebuchadnezzar	did.
    c. The	queen	was	 **confident** in	Daniel’s	ability	to	interpret	the	writing.
5. Daniel	5:13	– _Then	Daniel	was	brought	in	before	the	king.	The	king	spoke	and	said	to	Daniel,	_
    _“Are	you	that	Daniel	who	is	one	of	the	exiles	from	Judah,	whom	my	father	the	king	brought	_
    _from	Judah?_ Belshazzar	listened	to	the	queen’s	 **advice** and	summoned	Daniel.
    a. Belshazzar	knew	more	about	Daniel	than	he	cared	to	admit.	This	information	about	
       Daniel	being	a	 **Jewish** deportee	did	not	come	from	the	queen.
    b. Belshazzar	may	have	been	trying	to	intimidate	Daniel,	since	he	mentioned	his	Jewish	
       nationality	twice,	reminding	everyone	in	earshot	that	Daniel	had	been	brought	as	a	
       **captive** from	Judah.
    c. Despite	his	terror	from	the	handwriting	on	the	wall,	Belshazzar	took	the	opportunity	to	
       belittle	Daniel	proclaiming	that	he	was _one	of	the	exiles_ from	Judah. He	did	this	while	he	
       insulted God,	 **blatantly** using	the	gold	vessels	from	the	temple	at	his	drinking party.






d. The	fact	that	Belshazzar	had	never	personally	met	Daniel	highlights	the	probability	that	
Daniel	was	no	longer	in	a	 place of	authority	in	Babylon.

6. Daniel	5:14	– _Now	I	have	heard	about	you	that	a	spirit	of	the	gods	is	in	you,	and	that	_
    _illumination,	insight	and	extraordinary	wisdom	have	been	found	in	you_ .	The	king	recounted	
    the	queen’s	 **words** describing	Daniel’s	unparalleled	wisdom.
7. Daniel	5:15	– _Just	now	the	wise	men	and	the	conjurers	were	brought	in	before	me	that	they	_
    _might	read	this	inscription	and	make	its	interpretation	known	to	me,	but	they	could	not	_
    _declare	the	interpretation	of	the	message_ .	The	king’s	statements	graphically	exposed the	
    bankruptcy	of	 **human** wisdom.
8. Daniel	5:16a	– _“But	I	personally	have	heard	about	you,	that	you	are	able	to	give	_
    _interpretations	and	_ **_solve_** _difficult	problems...”_
    a. It	sounds	like	Belshazzar	had	 _personally_ **heard** of	Daniel	before	this	event.
    b. Although	Belshazzar	had	previously	heard	about	Daniel’s	supernatural	ability	to	
       interpret	dreams	and	explain	riddles,	he	did	not	call	for	him	until	after	the	 **queen**
       suggested	he	do	so.
9. Daniel	5:16b	– _“...Now	if	you	are	able	to	read	the	inscription	and	make	its	interpretation	_
    _known	to	me...”_ Belshazzar	was	not	convinced	at	this	point	that	Daniel	could	indeed	read	
    and	interpret	the	inscription.	He	challenged	Daniel	to	 **prove** his	reputation.
10. Daniel	5:16c	– _“...Now	if	you	are	able	...you	will	be	clothed	with	purple	and	wear	a	necklace	_
    _of	gold	around	your	neck,	and	you	will	have	authority	as	the	third	ruler	in	the	kingdom.”_ He	
    offered	Daniel	the	same	reward	he	had	offered	the	other	wise	men,	including	being	named	
    the	third	highest	 **ruler** in	the	kingdom	of	Babylon.
    a. The	fact	that	he	offered	Daniel	to	be	the	 _third	ruler	in	the	kingdom_ is	strong	proof	that	
       Belshazzar	was	actually	second	in	command,	under	his	 **absent** imperial	father.
    b. This	was	an	amazing	offer.	In	the	case	of	the	untimely	deaths	of	Belshazzar	and	his	
       father	Nabonidus,	this	third	ruler	in	the	kingdom	would	immediately	become	 **king**.
    c. It	was	not	uncommon	for	Persian	kings	to	allow	conquered	leaders	to	 **remain** in	
       positions	of	authority.	This	may	account	for	why	Daniel	quickly	became	prominent	in	
       the	Persian	government.

**E. Daniel	5:17- 24	 – Daniel’s	stinging	rebuke	of	King	Belshazzar**

1. Daniel	5:17	– _Then	Daniel	answered	and	said	before	the	king,	“Keep	your	gifts	for	yourself	or	_
    _give	your	rewards	to	someone	else;	however,	I	will	read	the	inscription	to	the	king	and	make	_
    _the	interpretation	known	to	him_ .	Daniel	bluntly	 **refused** any	compensation.	He	would	not	let	
    economic	benefits	motivate	or	cloud	his	interpretation	of	the	message.
2. Daniel	5:18	– _O	king,	the	Most	High	God	granted	sovereignty,	grandeur,	glory	and	majesty	_
    _to	Nebuchadnezzar	your	father_ [or	your	ancestor].	As	the	first	order	of	business,	Daniel	
    **clarified** the	fact	that	God,	not	man,	had	given	king	Nebuchadnezzar	his	splendor	and	royal	
    authority.





3. Daniel	5:19a	– _Because	of	the	grandeur	which	He	bestowed	on	him,	all	the	peoples,	nations	_
    _and	men	of	every	language	feared	and	trembled	before	him._ Daniel	reminded	Belshazzar	
    from	 **whom** Nebuchadnezzar	had	gotten	his	authority.
4. Daniel	5:19b	– Nebuchadnezzar	killed	those	he	wanted	to	kill	and	spared	those	he	wanted	
    to	spare.	He	also	honored	those	he	wanted	to	honor	and	disgraced	those	he	wanted	to	
    humble.	God	 **gave** him	amazing	authority	and	power.
5. Daniel	5:20	– But	when	Nebuchadnezzar	claimed	personal	authorship	for	his	God-given	
    magnificence,	God	profoundly **abased** him.	 _But	when	his	heart	was	lifted	up	and	his	spirit	_
    _became	so	proud	that	he	behaved	arrogantly,	he	was	deposed	from	his	royal	throne	and	his	_
    _glory	was	taken	away	from	him_.
    a. God	rules,	not	man.	When	a	world	leader	acts	arrogantly,	 **God** maintains	the	power.	
       God	reserves	the	right	to	send	judgment	and remove	any	leader	from	office.
    b. Daniel	reminded	Belshazzar	that	God	humbled	Nebuchadnezzar.	The	 **memory** of	seeing	
       his	grandfather	eating	grass	like	an	animal	may	have	been	etched	into	Belshazzar’s	soul.
    c. Daniel	focused	on	Nebuchadnezzar’s pride.	It	was	his	 **pride** that	led	to	God’s	abasement	
       of	Nebuchadnezzar.	This	same	arrogance	was	leading	Belshazzar	to	an	untimely	death.
6. Daniel	5:21a	– _He	was	also	driven	away	from	mankind,	and	his	heart	was	made	like	that	of	_
    _beasts,	and	his	dwelling	place was	with	the	wild	donkeys.	He	was	given	grass	to	eat	like	_
    _cattle,	and	his	body	was	drenched	with	the	dew	of	heaven..._ This	reminded	proud	Belshazzar	
    of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	failure	and	 **judgment**.
7. Daniel	5:21b	– God	left	this	heavy	judgment	over	Nebuchadnezzar _...until	he	recognized	that	_
    _the	Most	High	God	is	ruler	over	the	realm	of	mankind	and	that	He	sets	over	it	whomever	He	_
    _wishes_ .	Sadly,	Belshazzar	was	not	being	offered	a	second	chance,	or	an	opportunity	to	learn	
    from	his	mistakes.	Instead	he	was	about	to	hear	that	he	had	already	been	 **judged**.
8. Daniel	5:22	– Belshazzar	deliberately	and	knowingly	 **defied** God.	 _Yet	you,	his	son,	_
    _Belshazzar,	have	not	humbled	your	heart,	even	though	you	knew	all	this_ .	Belshazzar’s	
    profane	use	of	the	holy	vessels	from	God’s	temple	in	drunken	revelry	that	very	night	was	
    red-handed	proof	of	his	proud	defiance	of	God.
9. Daniel	5:23	– Daniel	proceeded	to	pronounce	a	four-part	 **indictment** against	Belshazzar.


a. Daniel	5:23a	– You	defied	 almighty God.	 ...but	you	have	exalted	yourself	against	the	Lord	
of	heaven ...
b. Daniel	5:23b	– You	 led your	people	to	profane	the	vessels	devoted	to	the	worship	of	
God.	 ...and	they	have	brought	the	vessels	of	His	house	before	you,	and	you	and	your	
nobles,	your	wives	and	your	concubines	have	been	drinking	wine	from	them.
c. Daniel	5:23c	– You	foolishly	worshiped lifeless	 images .	 ...and	you	have	praised	the	gods	
of	silver	and	gold,	of	bronze,	iron,	wood	and	stone,	which	do	not	see,	hear	or	
understand.






d. Daniel	5:23d – You	have	not	given	 glory to	the	God	who	gave you	your	life	and	breath.	
But	the	God	in	whose	hand	are	your	life-breath	and	all	your	ways,	you	have	not	glorified.
1) Truth :	As	supreme,	God	alone	is	worthy	of	worship	(Is.	44:6-8)	All	authority	
originates	from	God.	Jeremiah	27:5-7,	Hebrews	1:3,	Colossians	1:16- 17
2) Lie :	Men	are	capable	of	creating	living	gods worthy	of	worship	(Jer.	10:1-5).	Kings	
gain authority	by	their	own	doings.	Jeremiah	10:6- 25

10. Daniel	5:24	– _Then	the	hand	was	sent	from	Him	and	this	inscription	was	written	out_ .	
    Belshazzar’s	misuse	of	the	temple	vessels	was	the	 **catalyst** behind	the	message	on	the	wall.
    a. What	was	a	big	difference	between	the	pride	of	Nebuchadnezzar	and	the	pride	of	
       Belshazzar?	Belshazzar	openly	challenged	God,	whereas	Nebuchadnezzar	did	not	
       **directly** challenge	Him.	God	met	Belshazzar’s	challenge	head	on.
    b. Only	after	giving	Belshazzar	a	lengthy	 **rebuke** in	front	of	all	the	guests	and	officials	at	the	
       party,	was	Daniel	ready	to	interpret	the	handwriting	on	the	wall.

**F. Daniel	5:25- 31	 – Daniel interpreted	the message	on	the	wall**

1. Daniel	5:25	– _Now	this	is	the	inscription	that	was	written	out:	“MENE,	MENE,	TEKEL,	_
    _UPHARSIN.”_ Written	in	Aramaic,	the	translation	is	“Numbered,	numbered,	weighed,	and	
    divided.”	Even	though	written	in	the	language	of	the	Chaldeans,	these	Aramaic	 **words** were	
    not	understood	by	the	wise	men	of	Babylon.	They	could	not	understand	their	significance.
2. Daniel	5:26- 28	 – _This	is	the	interpretation	of	the	message..._ Daniel	gave	the	meaning	of	the	
    words	one	by	one.
    a. Daniel	5:26	– _“MENE”	God	has	numbered	your	kingdom	and	put	an	end	to	it.”_ MENE	
       means	“to	 **number** .”	The	countdown	was	on.	The	word	 _number_ MENE	was	repeated	
       twice.	This	may	have	emphasized	the	immediacy	of	the	judgment	poised	to	fall	on	this	
       seemingly	invincible	kingdom.	Genesis	41:32
    b. Daniel	5: 27	 – _“TEKEL”	you	have	been	weighed	on	the	scales	and	found	deficient.	_ TEKEL	
       means	“to	weigh.”	God	evaluated	the	Babylonian	Empire	under	Belshazzar’s	leadership	
       and,	using	His	 **holy** standards,	he	found	it	totally	unworthy	of	continued	existence.
    c. Daniel	5:28	– _“PERES”	your	kingdom	has	been	divided	and	given	over	to	the	Medes	and	_
       _Persians.”_ PERES	means	“to	 **divide** .”	God	divided	the	Babylonian	Empire	between	the	
       Medes	and	Persians.
3. Daniel	5:29	– _Then	Belshazzar	gave	orders,	and	they	clothed	Daniel	with	purple	and put	a	_
    _necklace	of	gold	around	his	neck,	and	issued	a	proclamation	concerning	him	that	he	now	_
    _had	authority	as	the	third	ruler	in	the	kingdom_ .	Amazingly,	Belshazzar	rewarded	Daniel	as	he	
    had	promised,	even	though	Daniel’s	interpretation	announced	the	 **doom** of	the	empire.
4. Daniel	5:30	– _That	same	night	Belshazzar	the	Chaldean	king	was	slain_ .	That	very	night,	as	
    Daniel	was	receiving	this	promotion,	the	Persian	 **army** was	preparing	to	conquer	the	city	
    and	execute	King	Belshazzar.





5. Daniel	5:31	– _So	Darius	the	Mede	received	the	kingdom	at	about	the	age	of	sixty-two_ .	The	
    fall of	Babylon	meant	the	rise	of	Medo-Persia,	the	arms	and	chest	of	silver	from	Daniel	2:32.	
    The	head	of	gold,	the	most	valuable	part	of	the	statue,	did	not	last	very	long.

**G. Considerations	from	Daniel	five**

1. God	is	sovereign.	He	is	the	one	who	raises	up	and	brings	 **down** governments.	God	is	able	to	
    bring	down	even	the	strongest	ruler.	Psalm	29:10,	33:16-17;	Isaiah	40:15;	Jeremiah	10:10;	
    Romans	13:1
2. When	the	wicked	are	in	power,	take	 **refuge** in	God.	He	will	take	care	of	you	just	like	He	took	
    care	of	Daniel	and	his	Hebrew	friends.	Psalm	7:1,	11:1-7,	56:3
3. Pride	is	a	dangerous	 **enemy** .	Isaiah	2:12,	Proverbs	16:18
4. It	is	often	easy	to	recognize	pride	in	a	nation,	a	 **leader** ,	a	friend	or	a	family	member,	but	to	
    see	pride	in	yourself	is	often	the	most	difficult.	Proverbs	16:81,	John	8:7-11,	1	Corinthians	
    8:2,	10:12
5. God	is	not	impressed	with	man’s	wealth,	wisdom,	talents,	security	or	fame;	He	is	looking	for	
    people	who	will	 **trust** Him	unquestionably.	Philippians	3:7;	Hebrews 3:19,	11:6
6. You	should	not	trust	in	a	job,	a	political	party,	connections,	houses	or	lands,	or	money.	Your	
    trust	must	be	in	the	Lord	 **alone** .	Proverbs	3:5-6,	Jeremiah	17:5-10,	James	4:13- 16
7. The	combined	court	of	Belshazzar’s	wise	men	had	no	answers.	Human	wisdom	is	
    **foolishness** to	God.	1	Corinthians	1:20,	3:19





**IX. Daniel	6:1- 28	 – Daniel	in	the	Lion’s	Den**

**A. The	history	of	Persia’s	rise	to	power**

1. The	history	of	the	Persian	Empire	involves	two	groups	of	people,	the	Medes	and	the	
    Persians,	who	 **joined** forces	to	conquer	the	world.
2. In	539	BC,	the	Medo-Persian	Empire	came	to	power	by	conquering	the	Babylonians.	With	
    the	acquisition	of	the	Babylonian	Empire,	the	total	land	 **mass** under	Persian	rule	doubled	in	
    size.
3. Eventually,	Persia	 **ruled** the	Middle	East,	Egypt,	the	Caucasus	and	much	of	modern	day	
    Pakistan	and	India.	They	also	had	a	huge	influence	on	central	Asia	(modern	day	Turkey),	
    which	they	conquered	and	controlled	for	centuries.
4. They	were	never	able	to	substantially	break	into	Europe	and	fully	conquer	the	Greek	city	
    states,	but	they	did	manage	to	make	the	Greeks	their	avowed	 **enemies**.
5. The	first	Persian	king	was	Cyrus.	God	had	the	prophet	Isaiah	prophesy	concerning	Cyrus,	by	
    name,	more	than	100	years	before	his	 **birth** and	his	subsequent	rise	to	power.	Isaiah	44:28,	
    45:1
6. The	Persians	under	Cyrus	were	responsible	for	liberating	the	Jewish	people	from	Babylonian	
    captivity	and	encouraging	their	 **return** to	the	land	to	rebuild	Jerusalem	and	its	temple.

**B. Daniel’s	book	teaches	us	about	God**

1. Daniel	1	– God	displayed	His	 **control** over	circumstances	by	allowing	Daniel	and	his	friends	
    to	find	favor	and	advancement	in	a	pagan	government.
2. Daniel	2	– Through	Daniel’s	interpretation	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream,	God	displayed	His	
    comprehensive	 **knowledge** (omniscience)	by	revealing	precise	details	concerning	the	times	
    of	the	Gentiles.
3. Daniel	3	– God	displayed	His	 **power** to	save	by	delivering	the	three	Hebrew	youths	through	
    the	fiery	furnace.
4. Daniel	4	– God	displayed	His	 **sovereignty** over	human	authorities	by	humbling	the	most	
    powerful	monarch	on	earth,	King	Nebuchadnezzar.
5. Daniel	5	– God	displayed	His	 **justice** by	eliminating	Babylon	as	a	kingdom	the	very	night	King	
    Belshazzar	led	his	people	to	blaspheme	and	disregard	God’s	holiness.
6. Daniel	6	– God	again	displayed	 **all** these	attributes	(control	over	circumstances,	complete	
    knowledge,	power	to	save,	sovereignty,	and	justice)	when	He	delivered	Daniel	from	the	
    lions.





**C. Daniel	6:1a	– Who	was	Darius	the	Mede?**

1. Daniel	6:1a	– _It	seemed	good	to	_ **_Darius_** ...	Daniel	5:31
    a. Darius	the	Mede	was	likely	a	 **coregent** with	Cyrus	the	Persian,	appointed	to	rule	over	
       the	Babylonian	aspects	of	the	Medo-Persian	Empire.	Daniel	6:28	says	Daniel	prospered	
       _in	the	reign	of	Darius,	and	in	the	reign	of	Cyrus	the	Persian_ ...	
    b. Daniel	9:1	 **confirms** Darius’	appointment	over	Babylon.	 _In	the	first	year	of	Darius	the	son	_
       _of	Ahasuerus,	of	Median	descent,	_ **_who	was	made	king_** _over	the	kingdom	of	the	_
       _Chaldeans_ .	
2. Some	historians	have	a	problem	with	Darius	being	a	real	 **person** because	there	seems	to	be	
    no	extra-biblical	record	to	identify	him.	
    a. Although	it	is	difficult	to	be	dogmatic	about	his	exact	identity,	we	can	be	absolutely	
       dogmatic	about	the	 **inerrancy** of	Scripture.
    b. Jesus	Christ	never	doubted	the	historical	trustworthiness	of	the	book	of	Daniel.	He	
       quoted	from	the	book	of	Daniel	as	if	it	were	completely	 **accurate** ,	and,	of	course,	Jesus	
       never	made	mistakes.	Matthew	24:30	
    c. You	must	not	 **allow** the	criticism	of	skeptics	to	discredit	the	Bible’s	accuracy.

**D. Daniel	6:1b- 3	 – Daniel’s	success	in	the	Persian	Empire**

1. Daniel	6:1b	– _It	seemed	good	to	Darius	to	appoint	120	satraps	over	the	kingdom,	that	they	_
    _would	be	in	charge	of	the	whole	kingdom_ .	Satraps	were	regional	leaders.	Darius	strategically	
    employed	indigenous	leaders	to	 **manage** the	affairs	of	the	empire	in	their	respective	
    regions.
2. Daniel	6:2	– _...and	over	them	three	commissioners	(of	whom	Daniel	was	one),	that	these	_
    _satraps	might	be	accountable	to	them,	and	that	the	king	might	not	suffer	loss._ Daniel	was	
    one	of	the	 **three** appointed	presidents over	the	120	regional	leaders.
    a. The	presidents	answered	directly	to	Darius.	Their	task	was	to	ensure	that	the	satraps	
       were	 **honest** in	collecting	taxes	and	other	revenue.
    b. Because	the	land	mass	of	Persia	was	greater	than	that	of	Babylon,	it	needed	this	kind	of	
       organizational	structure	to	 **manage** and	control	its	expansive	and	multicultural	empire.
    c. Instead	of	doing	away	with	the	previous	Babylonian	leadership,	Persia	decided to	
       incorporate	it	in	its	government	structure.	Since	Daniel	had	recently	been	appointed	the	
       number	three	leader	in	Babylon,	he	was	likely	a	natural	 **choice** for	one	of	the	three	high	
       positions.
3. Daniel	6:3	– _Then	this	Daniel	began	distinguishing	himself	among	the	commissioners	and	_
    _satraps	because	he	possessed	an	extraordinary	spirit,	and	the	king planned	to	appoint	him	_
    _over	the	entire	kingdom._ Daniel	was	 **honest** and	capable,	and	he	was	excelling	in	the	new	
    government.






a. He	was	slated	for	promotion	over	nearly	everything	in	the	kingdom,	but	he	was	also	
Jewish ,	and	that	was	a	problem	for	some	of	his	peers. His	ethnicity	and	honesty	would	
have	won	him	a	host	of	corrupt	and	jealous	enemies.	
b. Daniel	was	probably	accustomed	to	conspiracies	by	his	peers.	Being	an	honest	person	in	
government,	he	would	have	been	a	problem	for	anyone	who	might	be	taking	 advantage
of	his	position	and	power	for	unethical	personal	gain.

**E. Daniel	6:4- 5	 – Jealousy,	an	ugly	matter**

1. Daniel	6:4	– _Then	the	commissioners	and	satraps	began	trying	to	find	a	ground	of	_
    _accusation	against	Daniel	in	regard	to	government	affairs;	but	they	could	find	no	ground	of	_
    _accusation	or	evidence	of	corruption,	inasmuch	as	he	was	faithful,	and	no	negligence	or	_
    _corruption	was	to	be	found	in	him_ .	The	conspirators could	not	find	any	 **fault** with	Daniel.
    a. Daniel	was	loyal	to	the	 **king** and	his	character	was	spotless.	He	was	not	negligent	in	his	
       work.	He	did	not	put	his	personal	interests	above	those	of	the	king.	No	one	could	find	
       any	fault	in	what	he	did.	Philippians	2:15,	1	Peter	2:11- 12
    b. We	might	be	tempted	to	praise	Daniel,	but	we	know	he	prospered	because	of	God’s	
       work	in	his	life.	As	he	aged,	he	grew	in	dependence	on	the	Lord.	He	learned	to	live	for	
       the	 **glory** of	God	rather	than	for	selfish	gain.	This	was	spiritual	maturity	in	progress.
2. Daniel	6:5	– _Then	these	men	said,	“We	will	not	find	any	ground	of	accusation	against	this	_
    _Daniel	unless	we	find	it	against	him	with	regard	to	the	law	of	his	God.”_ These	deceitful	men	
    eventually	conspired	to	 **destroy** Daniel	based	on	his	loyalty	to	God	and	His	word.
    a. Daniel’s	integrity	was	so	intact	his	conspirators	realized	the	only	way	to	get	rid	of	him	
       was	by	means	his	strengths:	his	unbending	principles	and	worship	of	God.	They	would	
       have	to	use	 **deception** in	order	to	trap,	blame,	and	ultimately	destroy	Daniel.
    b. They	may	have	known	that	Jews	did	not	worship	idols.	The	story	of	the	three	Hebrew	
       youths	who	would	not	disobey	God	and	worship	an	idol,	even	in	the	face	of	death,	may	
       still	have	been	 **told** at	that	time.
    c. These	men	decided	to	trick	the	king	into	enacting	an	irrevocable	law,	similar	to	
       Nebuchadnezzar’s demands	to	worship	a	false	god,	which	would	ensnare	Daniel.	
       Because	of	the	law	of	the	Medes	and	Persians,	even	the	king	would	be	obliged	to	carry	
       through	on	its	death	 **penalty** requirements.

**F. Daniel	6:6- 9	 – A	prayer	ban**

1. Daniel	6:6	– _Then	these	commissioners	and	satraps	came	by	agreement	to	the	king	and	_
    _spoke	to	him	as	follows:	“King	Darius,	live	forever!_
    a. The	Aramaic	word	 _agreement_ means	they	came	as	a	 **mob** .	They	came	“en	masse”	to	
       present	their	plan	to	the	king.
    b. Coming	in	this	way	would	have	communicated	popularity	and	unity	on	the	subject.	The	
       king	would	have	been	flattered,	making	him	 **blind** to	their	treachery.






c. The	magnitude	of	this	 scheme shows	how	many	enemies	Daniel	had	unjustifiably	
acquired.	John	15:18- 19

2. Daniel	6:7	– _“All	the	commissioners	of	the	kingdom,	the	prefects	and	the	satraps,	the	high	_
    _officials	and	the	governors	have	consulted	together	that	the	king	should	establish	a	statute	_
    _and	_ **_enforce_** _an	injunction	that	anyone	who	makes	a	petition	to	any	god	or	man	besides	you,	_
    _O	king,	for	thirty	days,	shall	be	cast	into	the	lions’	den._
    a. This	law	would	put	Darius	on	the	level	of	a	god	for	 **thirty** days.	Daniel’s	conspirators	
       were	well	aware	this	law	would	appeal	to	the	king’s	pride;	it	would	be	an	irresistible	
       proposal.
    b. Anyone	who	didn’t	obey	the	new	law	would	be	fed	to	starving	 **lions** .	This	was	a	barbaric	
       form	of	capital	punishment	used	by	the	Medes	and	Persians	to	put	fear	into	the	heart	of	
       any	would-be	criminal.
3. Daniel	6:8	– _“Now,	O	king,	establish	the	injunction	and	sign	the	document	so	that	it	may	not	_
    _be	changed,	according	to	the	law	of	the	Medes	and	Persians,	which	may	not	be	_ **_revoked_** _.”_
    a. The	plan	was	a	conspiracy	that	would	outmaneuver	even	the	 **authority** of	King	Darius.
    b. The	conspirators	pressured	the	king	to	draft	and	sign	the	law	quickly	because,	once	
       signed,	the	law	could	not	be	changed.	The	trap	was	 **set** for	Daniel.	Esther	8:8
4. Daniel	6:9	– _Therefore	King	Darius	signed	the	document,	that	is,	the	injunction._ With	the	
    stroke	of	a	pen,	the	king	outlawed	prayer	to	any	god	for	 **thirty** days.
    a. These	conspirators	knew	two	things:	Daniel	was	faithful	to	 **pray** and	the	king	had	a	
       gullible	ego.
    b. Although	they	acted	like	they	loved	and	honored	the	king,	in	reality	they	treated	him	as	
       a	 **fool**.
    c. Because	of	his	foolish	pride,	the	king	unsuspectingly	 **fell** for	the	plan.

**G. Daniel	6:10- 11	 – Loyalty	exploited**

1. Daniel	6:10	– _Now	when	Daniel	knew	that	the	document	was	signed,	he	entered	his	house	_
    _(now	in	his	roof	chamber	he	had	windows	open	toward	Jerusalem);	and	he	continued	_
    _kneeling	on	his	knees	three	times	a	day,	praying	and	giving	thanks	before	his	God,	as	he	had	_
    _been	doing_ **_previously_**_._ This	speaks	volumes	about	the	kind	of	person	Daniel	was.
    a. Daniel	was	resolute	in	his	faith.	Even	though	he	knew	about	the	law,	and	that	he’d	die	a	
       gruesome	death	for	breaking	it,	he	 **entrusted** himself	to	the	Lord	and	continued	
       worshipping	Him	just	as	he	had	always	done.	Acts	4:29,	2	Corinthians	3:12,	Philippians	
       1:14,	1	Peter	2:23
       1) Despite	the	fearful	law,	Daniel	 **rested** in	the	Lord	and	went	about	his	business	as	
          usual.	Isaiah	26:3,	Philippians	4:7
       2) He	did	not	stop	praying	or	start	praying	in	 **secret**.






3) He	did	not	call	his	lawyers.	He	did	not	start	a	 protest or	write	a	petition.	He	did	not	
do	anything	to	try	to	defend	himself	or	to	try	to	get	out	of	his	predicament.	1	Peter	
4:19
4) Instead	Daniel	chose	to	continue	praying	as	usual.	He	must	have	believed	that	his	
fellowship	with	God	was	more	important	than	his	life	or	 position.
b. Daniel	did	not	fear	physical	death.	From	Daniel	12:1-3	we	know	Daniel	believed	in	a	
literal,	future,	bodily	resurrection.
c. Several	 Old Testament	passages	help	us	understand	the	intensity	and	intentionality	of	
Daniel’s	prayer	life.
1) Daniel	prayed	 three times	daily,	as	the	writer	of	Psalm	55:16-17	encouraged.
2) Daniel	prayed	 facing Jerusalem,	as	1	Kings	8:46-51	commanded	Israel	to	do.	
3) Daniel had	a	 copy of	Jeremiah’s	writings	(Daniel	9:2).	Jeremiah	said	to	pray	from	
captivity	for	the	restoration	of	Israel,	and	God	would	hear	and	respond.	Daniel	
believed	and	acted	on	Jeremiah’s	prophesies.	Jeremiah	29:11- 13
4) In	Daniel	9,	Daniel	confessed	his	own sins	as	well	as	the	sins	of	Israel.	We	can	safely	
conclude	that	he	prayed	consistently	for	Israel’s	 release from	captivity.
d. Daniel	6:11	– Then	these	men	came	by	agreement	 [as	a	mob] and	found	Daniel	making	
petition	and	supplication	before	his	God .	The	conspirators’	plan	worked,	largely	because	
of	Daniel’s	loyalty,	the	same	trait,	incidentally,	that	forced	them	to	be	 honest in	their	
jobs.	Daniel’s	faithfulness	got	him	into	trouble,	but	his	faith	would	bring	him	out.	
Hebrews	11:33

**H. Daniel	6:12- 15	 – Tattletales**

1. Daniel	6:12a	– _Then	they	approached	and	spoke	before	the	king	about	the	king’s	injunction,	_
    _“Did	you	not	sign	an	injunction	that	any	man	who	makes	a	petition	to	any	god	or	man	_
    _besides	you,	O	king,	for	thirty	days,	is	to	be	cast	into	the	lions’	den?”_ The	conspirators	were	
    primed	as	they	came	before	the	king	to	 **denounce** Daniel.
2. Daniel	6:12b	– _The	king	replied,	“The	statement	is	true,	according	to	the	law	of	the	Medes	_
    _and	Persians,	which	may	not	be	revoked.”	_ They	received	the	exact	answer	they	wanted.	The	
    king	acknowledged	that	the	law	could	not	be	revoked.	He	now	had	no	 **legal** option,	but	to	
    condemn	Daniel	to	death.
3. Daniel	6:13	– _Then	they	answered	and	spoke	before	the	king,	“Daniel,	who	is	one	of	the	_
    _exiles	from	Judah,	pays	no	attention	to	you,	O	king,	or	to	the	injunction	which	you	signed,	_
    _but	keeps	making	his	petition	three	times	a	day.”_ Making	an	issue	of	Daniel’s	Jewish	
    ethnicity	and	exile	status,	the	conspirators	made	two	 **inaccurate** accusations	against	Daniel.
    a. _[Daniel]	pays	no	attention	to	you,	O	king_ ...	They	misrepresented	Daniel	when	they	
       asserted	that	he	paid	 _no	attention_ to	the	king.	Daniel	was	loyal	to	the	king,	but	his	God	
       was	a	 **higher** authority	than	the	king.	Acts	5:29






b. [Daniel]	pays	no	attention	to	...	the	injunction	which	you	signed... They	misrepresented	
Daniel	by	implying	that	he	 blatantly disregarded	the	king’s	law.
c. Daniel,	who	is	one	of	the	exiles	from	 Judah ...	The	accusations	were	a	veiled	repetition of	
the	antisemitism	we	have	seen	throughout	the	book	of	Daniel	and	throughout	history.	
Antisemitism	is	satanic;	Satan	wants	to	see	God’s	nation,	Israel,	destroyed.	Esther	3:6,	
Psalm	83:4

4. Daniel	6:14	– _Then,	as	soon	as	the	king	heard	this	statement,	he	was deeply	distressed	and	_
    _set	his	mind	on	delivering	Daniel;	and	even	until	sunset	he	kept	exerting	himself	to	rescue	_
    _him.	_ King	Darius	immediately	recognized	the	dire	legal	consequences	of	the	situation.	He	
    spent	the	balance of	the	day	in	a fruitless search	for	a	 **loophole** to	preserve	Daniel’s	life.
5. Daniel	6:15	– _Then	these	men	came	by	agreement	_ [as	a	mob] _to	the	king	and	said	to	the	_
    _king,	“Recognize,	O	king,	that	it	is	a	law	of	the	Medes	and	Persians	that	no	injunction	or	_
    _statute	which	the	king	establishes	may be	changed.”_ The	law	allowed	the	king	no solution,	
    and	he	was	obligated	to	enforce	the	 **death** penalty	on	Daniel.
    a. Darius	was	not	a	 **weak** ruler.	Although	at	that	moment	his	hands	were	tied	and	he	had	
       to	fulfill	the	law’s	demands,	he	would	remember	who	instigated	this	plot.
    b. The	king	would	not	have	appreciated	the	fact	that	he	was	being	manipulated	any	more	
       than	you	or	I	would.	You	cannot	poke	a	 **bear** without	getting	a	ferocious	response.

**I. Daniel	6:16- 22	 – Daniel’s	deliverance**

1. Daniel	6:16a	– _Then	the	king	gave	orders,	and	Daniel	was	brought	in	and	cast	into	the	lions’	_
    _den._ In	the	literary	simplicity	of	ancient	writings,	the	author	concisely	summarized	Daniel’s	
    **doom**.
2. Daniel	6:16b	– _The	king	spoke	and	said	to	Daniel,	“Your	God	whom	you	constantly	serve	will	_
    _Himself	deliver	you.”	_ The	king’s	 **confidence** in	Daniel’s	God,	that	He	was	able	to	deliver	
    Daniel	from	a	bunch	of	hungry	lions,	showed	great	faith.	Was	he	familiar	with	the	story	of	
    Shadrach,	Meshach	and	Abednego?	Or	was	it	a	result	of	Daniel’s	life	and	testimony?
3. Daniel	6:17	– _A	stone	was	brought	and	laid	over	the	mouth	of	the	den;	and	the	king	sealed	it	_
    _with	his	own	signet	ring	and	with	the	signet	rings	of	his	nobles,	so	that	nothing	would	be	_
    _changed	in	regard	to	Daniel_ .	Steps	were	taken	to	 **ensure** the	execution	of	Daniel	was	
    fulfilled	properly,	according	to	the	letter	of	the	law.
    a. While	the	seal	with	the	signet	ring	served	as	proof	that	the	decree	had	been	carried	out,	
       it	also	ensured	that	no	one	 **disrupted** the	execution.
    b. Clearly	no	one	would	dare	break	that	seal	for	fear	of	retribution,	but	this	fact	would	also	
       serve	as	absolute	proof	that	God	 **alone** delivered	Daniel.	No	one	could	ever	say	some	
       person	rescued	him.	Matthew	27:62- 66
4. Daniel	6:18	– _Then	the	king	went	off	to	his	palace	and	spent	the	night	fasting,	and	no	_
    _entertainment	was	brought	before	him;	and	his	sleep	fled	from	him._ The	thought	of	losing	
    Daniel	to	the	lions	robbed	the	king	of	his	sleep	and	his	 **appetite**.





5. Daniel	6:19	– _Then	the	king	arose	at	dawn,	at	the	break	of	day,	and	went	in	haste	to	the	_
    _lions’	den._ The	fact	that	the	king	rushed	quickly	to	see	Daniel	fate	showed	faith.	His	faith,	
    weak	as	it	was,	held	out	 **hope** of	hearing	Daniel’s	voice	from	below.
6. Daniel	6:20	– _When	he	had	come	near	the	den	to	Daniel,	he	cried	out	with	a	troubled	voice.	_
    _The	king	spoke	and	said	to	Daniel,	“Daniel,	servant	of	the	living	God,	has	your	God,	whom	_
    _you	constantly	serve,	been	able	to	deliver	you	from	the	lions?”_ Here	we	see	King	Darius’	
    basic	 **understanding** of	God	as	he	tremblingly	called	out	to	Daniel.	Hebrews	11:6
    a. The	king	had	a	 **basic** ,	but	important,	understanding	of	God’s	attributes.	He	spoke of	God	
       as	the	 _living	God_ .	Romans	1:19- 20
    b. The	king	must	have	had	somewhat	of	a	 **friendship** with	Daniel.
       1) He	 **cared** a	lot	about	Daniel’s	welfare.
       2) He	 **knew** Daniel	constantly	served	his	God.
       3) Daniel	was	obviously	not	ashamed	of	his	God,	and	the	king	clearly	 **respected** him	
          for	it.
       4) Not	only	did	Daniel	live	his	faith,	he	probably	 **talked** about	his	God,	since	the	king	
          had	a	basic	understanding	of	what	Daniel’s	God	was	like.
       5) The	king	believed	Daniel’s	God	had	the	 **power** to	save	him	from	hungry	lions.
7. Daniel	6:21	– _Then	Daniel	spoke	to	the	king,	“O	king,	live	forever!_ Daniel	responded	with	
    **respect** for	the	king,	indicating	that	he	harbored	no	resentment	toward	him.
8. Daniel	6:22a	– Daniel	gave	God	 **credit** for	his	deliverance.	 _“My	God	sent	His	angel	and	shut	_
    _the	lions’	mouths	and they	have	not	harmed	me...”_
    a. Daniel	was	delivered	to	the	lions	by	the	king’s	edict,	but	delivered	 **from** the	lions	by	
       God’s	angel.
    b. The	angel	that	came	may	have	been	an	angel	from	the	Lord	or	the	“Angel	of	the	Lord,”	
       the	pre-incarnate	Christ.	Daniel	spent	the	night	with	this	important	and	amazing	 **guest**.
9. Daniel	6:22b	– Next,	Daniel	tactfully	declared	his	innocence	before	God	and	king.	
    _“...inasmuch	as	I	was	found	_ **_innocent_** _before	Him;	and	also	toward	you,	O	king,	I	have	_
    _committed	no	crime.”_
    a. This	statement	shows	that	man’s	laws,	when	they	contradict	the	laws	of	God,	are	not	
       **valid**.
       1) If	you	disobey	a	human	law	in	order	to	obey	God’s	law,	your	conscience	is	 **clear**.
       2) Even	so,	you	may	 **suffer** penalties,	persecutions,	or	even	death	for	your	
          disobedience.
    b. Just	as	God	shut	the	lions’	mouths	because	Daniel	trusted	Him,	so	also	God	 **saves** every	
       person	who	puts	his	trust	in	the	person	and	work	of	Christ.






c. Daniel	could	do	 nothing to	save	himself	from	the	lions,	any	more	than	we	can	save	
ourselves	from	sin’s	penalty.	God	alone	saves	people,	and	He	does	so	freely	by	His	grace	
through	the	finished	work	of	Christ	on	Calvary.	Hebrews	11:33;	John	1:12,	3:36

**J. Daniel	6:23- 24	 – The	conspirator’s	doom**

1. Daniel	6:23	– _Then	the	king	was	very	pleased	and	gave	orders	for	Daniel	to	be	taken	up	out	_
    _of	the	den.	So,	Daniel	was	taken	up	out	of	the	den	and	no	injury	whatever	was	found	on	him,	_
    _because	he	had	trusted	in	his	God_ .	No	 **harm** had	come	to	Daniel.
2. Daniel	6:24a	– _The	king	then	gave	orders,	and	they	brought	those	men	who	had	maliciously	_
    _accused	Daniel,	and	they	cast	them,	their	children	and	their	wives	into	the	lions’	den..._ The	
    execution	of	the	conspirators	and	their	families	was	consistent	with	the	Persian	way	of	
    dealing	with	 **state** enemies.	These	men	reaped	what	they	had	sown.	Job	4:8,	Galatians	6:7
3. Daniel	6:24b	– ... _and	they	had	not	reached	the	bottom	of	the	den	before	the	lions	_
    _overpowered	them	and	crushed	all	their	bones_ .	The	lions	were	indeed	 **hungry** .	This	shows	
    that	God,	and	nothing	else,	prevented	Daniel’s	death.	Genesis	12:3

**K. Daniel	6:25- 28	 – A	gospel	tract**

1. Daniel	6:25	– _Then	Darius	the	king	wrote	to	all	the	peoples,	nations	and	men	of	every	_
    _language	who	were	living	in	all	the	land:	“May	your	peace	abound!_ Daniel’s	faith	in	God	
    **influenced** yet	another	a	king.	Darius	sent	out	a	declaration	about	the	 _living	God_.
    a. This	event	happened	just	prior	to	the	end	of	Israel’s	prophesied	seventy	years	of	
       **captivity**.
    b. King	Cyrus	would	soon	encourage	Israel’s	 **return** to	the	land.
    c. Did	Daniel’s	testimony	of	faith	in	God,	his	 **integrity** ,	and	the	exposing	of	his	conspirators	
       play	a	part	in	Cyrus’	positive	actions	toward	the	exiles	of	Israel?
    d. The	stage	was	set	for	Jewish	refugees	to	return	to	the	Promised	Land.	Since	Daniel,	who	
       represented	the	best	of	Israel,	was	seen	as	 **loyal** to	his	adoptive	government,	the	Jewish	
       people	would	not	be	perceived	as	subversive	or	threating	to	the	kingdom.
    e. Most	likely	the	deaths	of	so	many	antisemitic	leaders	helped	clear	the	way	for	Israel’s	
       **favor** before	the	king	and	likely	sent	a	sobering	message	to	Israel’s	enemies	throughout	
       the	entire	kingdom.
2. Daniel	6:26a	– _“I	make	a	decree	that	in	all	the	dominion	of	my	kingdom	men	are	to	fear	and	_
    _tremble	before	the	God	of	Daniel..._ ”	The	king’s	declaration	of	God’s	greatness	would	have	
    promulgated	a	healthy	 **fear** of	God	throughout	the	Persian	Empire.	Proverbs	1:7
3. Daniel	6:26b	– _“...For	He	is	the	living	God	and	enduring	forever,	and	His	kingdom	is	one	_
    _which	will	not	be	destroyed,	and	His	dominion	will	be	forever_ .”	Our	God	 **reigns** over	all.	
    Darius	learned	what	Nebuchadnezzar	had	learned	many	years	before	through	extreme	
    abasement:	that	God,	not	man,	rules	sovereignly	in	the	kingdoms	of	men.	Daniel	4:34- 35





4. Daniel	6:27	– _“He	delivers	and	rescues	and	performs	signs	and	wonders	in	heaven	and	on	_
    _earth,	who	has	also	delivered	Daniel	from	the	power	of	the	lions.”_ The	king	spoke	of	God’s	
    power	to	save.	He	included	Daniel’s	deliverance	from	the	lions	as	living	 **proof** of	God’s	
    delivering	power.
5. Daniel	6:28	– _So	this	Daniel	enjoyed success	in	the	reign	of	Darius	and	in	the	reign	of	Cyrus	_
    _the	Persian.	_ God	gave	Daniel	success	in	a	 **pagan** regime.
    a. Daniel’s	faith	and	faithfulness	was	an	encouragement	to	the	Israelites	living	both	during	
       and	after	the	captivity.	They	would	need	strong	faith,	like	that	of	Daniel’s,	as	they	faced	
       the	uncertainties	of	returning	to	Jerusalem	to	 **rebuild** the	temple.
    b. Daniel’s	faith	should	still	encourage	us	as	we	face	the	pressures	of	living	faithfully	to	
       God	in	these	 **trying** times	of	the	Gentiles.	Hebrews	11:1-3,	 33

**L. Lessons	from	Daniel	six**

1. When	is	it	okay	to	break	the	law?	When	the	law	of	a	legitimate	government	conflicts	with	
    the	mandates	of	Scripture,	we	 **must** obey	God	rather	than	man.	God’s	laws	preside	over	
    man’s	laws.	Acts	5:29
    a. Since	all	human	governments	gain	their	 **right** to	exist	from	God,	God	is	the	highest	
       authority	and	therefore	His	laws	take	precedence.	Romans	13:1-5,	1	Peter	2:13- 17
    b. Before	violating	a	human	law,	we	must	be	sure	it	oversteps	God’s	law.	The	Bible	has	
       several	examples	of	legitimate	 **civil** disobedience,	like	the	Egyptian	midwives	in	Exodus	
       1:15-21,	Rahab	in	Joshua	2:1-6,	and	Peter	and	John	in	Acts	4:18-21.
2. Man’s	worldview	constantly	supports	 **independence** from	God	as	the	path	to	the	
    betterment	of	humanity.	Nothing could	be	more	foolish,	destructive,	and	further	from	the	
    truth.	Genesis	3:3- 5
3. Watch	out	when	people	play	up	to	your	ego.	Often	that	is	an	attempt	to	manipulate	and	
    control	you.	Typically,	an	appeal	to	your	pride,	is	a	set-up	for	your	 **fall** .	Proverbs	11:2,	16:18,	
    18:12,	29:23
4. Like	Daniel,	do	what	is	right	before	God	in	and	out	of	the	sight	of	men.	When	people	are	
    watching	keep	doing	what	is	right	before	God	not	man.	Always	walk	in	 **fellowship** .	Matthew	
    6:1-16,	1	Corinthians	10:31,	1	Peter	4:11
5. God	blesses	believers	who	 **trust** in	Him	(Heb.	11:6).	Those	who	trust	the	Lord	often	impact	
    human	history	in	amazing	ways	and	bring	God	enduring	glory.
    a. When	we	are	falsely	 **accused** ,	Daniel	would	say	to	pray	and	not	fight.	1	Samuel	26:10-11,	
       Proverbs	20:22
    b. When	we	choose	to	walk	by	the	dictates	of	Scripture	we	will	wear	a	 **target** .	If	we	are	
       successful,	unregenerate	people	might	be	jealous,	undermine	us, and	even	plot	to	
       destroy	us.	1	John	3:12- 13
    c. Seek	the	 **good** of	those	who	hate	you	and	stay	humble.	Proverbs	29:10,	Romans	12:18-
       20






d. Remember	God	cares	for	his	own.	He	did	not	keep	Daniel	from	the	lions,	but	he	did	save	
him	 among the	lions.	That	is	typically	God’s	method.	Isaiah	43:1-2,	1	Corinthians	10:13
e. Daniel	trusted	the	Lord	in	the	midst	of	 trials .	There	is	nothing	wrong	with	praying	for	
God	to	save	you	in	your	trials,	but	continue	on	as	you	always	have. Psalm	37:7- 8
f. Don’t	stop	or	run	when	endangered;	just	keep	on	with	business	as	 usual .	Don’t	let	Satan	
score	a	victory	by	stopping	you	from	what	you’ve	always	done	through	a	threat	or	some	
fear.	John	14:27,	16:33;	2	Timothy	1:7

6. What	does	God	accomplish	through	our	 **trials** ?	Romans	5:3-5,	James	1:2-5,	1	Peter	1:6- 9


a. He	 strengthens us	by	means	of	trials. Isaiah	40:28- 31
b. He	 matures us	through	trials. Psalm	94:12- 13
c. He	 disciplines us	by	giving	us	trials.	Job	5:17,	Hebrews	12:5- 11
d. He	gets	our	undivided	 attention in	trials. Psalm	119:67,	71
e. Through	our	endurance	in	trials	He	encourages	 others to	be	bold.	Philippians	1:12- 14
f. In	trials	don’t	just	choose	the	easy	way	 out. Isaiah	50:10- 11
g. Intensify	your	prayers.	In	the	darkness	of	trials,	it	may	be	that	God	will	spend	the	night	
protecting	you	and	comforting	you	like	he	did	Daniel.	The	night	Darius	was	fitful	and	
sleepless,	Daniel enjoyed the	protection	of	God’s	angel. Isaiah	26:3- 4	





**X. Daniel	7:1- 28	 – A	vision	of	four	beasts**

**A. Daniel	7	– Setting	the	stage**

1. Chapter	six	ends	the	historical	accounting	of	events.	Chapter	seven	reverts	to	a	 **specific**
    experience	in	Daniel’s	life.
2. No	Bible	passage	gives	a	sharper	view	of	God’s	control	over	history.	Satan’s	evil	control	of	
    human	governments	will	terminate.	Then	God	will	set	up	His	righteous	government	and	He	
    will	rule	 **forever** .	All	who	have	trusted	in	Him	will	dwell	securely	with	Him	in	His	eternal	
    kingdom.
3. No	chapter	of	the	Bible	provides	a	better	view	of	the	remainder	of	human	history.	This	
    chapter	presents	a	captivating	interchange	between	history	and	prophecy,	verifying	the	
    **accuracy** of	the	Bible.
4. It	is	disconcerting	to	see	how	mankind	has	consistently	desired	to	have	dominion	over	his	
    fellow	man.	Over	the	centuries,	the	lust	for	power	has	continually	begotten	and	destroyed	
    **evil** human	empires.
5. Ancient	empires	had	geographical	and	logistical	limitations,	but	we	now	live	in	a	time	when
    **global** empires	are	within	reach.	In	recent	generations,	the	world	has	witnessed	the	rise	and	
    fall	of	would-be	empires,	i.e.,	Nazi,	British	and	Soviet.	But	as	this	chapter	teaches,	there	are	
    two	empires	that	will	yet	dominate	the	world;	one	evil,	the	other righteous.
6. In	this	chapter, we	learn	that	an	already-existent	evil	empire	will	one	day	gain	global	
    domination.	It	will	then	divide	into	ten	regional	governments	before	becoming	dominated	
    by	the	Antichrist.	Although	this	one-world	government	could	materialize	in	your	lifetime,	
    Church	Age	believers	will	 **exit** the	scene	before	the	Antichrist	takes	control.
7. The	vision	of	this	chapter	corresponds	with	Nebuchadnezzar’s	 **dream** in	Daniel	chapter	two,	
    but	it	differs	significantly	in	perspective.
    a. Nebuchadnezzar,	a	pagan	king,	saw	the	emerging	empires	in	terms	of	man’s	glory,	
       standing	upright,	stately,	and	majestic.	Daniel,	on	the	other	hand,	saw	these	emerging	
       empires	as	beastly	creatures	of	prey;	devouring	and	destroying.	Whereas	these	empires	
       were	appealing	to	Nebuchadnezzar;	they	seemed	harsh,	 **cruel** and	evil	to	Daniel.
    b. Nebuchadnezzar,	a	Gentile,	saw	human	governments	as	passive,	constituted	of	valuable	
       metals.	Daniel,	a	Jewish	captive,	saw	human	governments	as	menacing	creatures,	beasts	
       to	be	 **dreaded**.
    c. Nebuchadnezzar	saw	a	majestic	statue	of	man	in	all	his	glory,	viciously	vandalized	by	a	
       hurled	stone.	Conversely,	Daniel	saw	a	threatening	beast	destroyed	by	a	 **glorious** man:	
       The Son	of	Man.





**B. Daniel	7:1- 3	 – A	storm	on	the	sea**

1. Daniel	7:1a	– _In	the	first	year	of	Belshazzar	king	of	Babylon..._ The	events	recorded	in	chapter	
    seven	take	us	 **back** in	time.
    a. Historically	this	 **vision** occurred	between	chapters	four	and	five	of	Daniel.
    b. Daniel	had	this	vision	during	Belshazzar’s	first	year	of	rule,	in	approximately	553	BC.	This	
       was	nine	years	after	the	 **death** of	Nebuchadnezzar	and	about	14	years	before	the	fall	of	
       Babylon.
2. Daniel	7:1b	– ... _Daniel	saw	a	dream	and	visions	in	his	mind	as	he	lay	on	his	bed;	then	he	_
    _wrote	the	dream	down	and	related	the	following	summary	of	it._ Daniel,	who	was	now	in	his	
    sixties,	saw	this	dream	and	experienced	these	visions	all	in	one	 **night** .	He	then	took	the	time	
    to	carefully	record	the	details,	together	with	the	interpretation	he	was	given.
3. Daniel	7:2	– _Daniel	said,	“I	was	looking	in	my	vision	by	night,	and	behold,	the	four	winds	of	_
    _heaven	were	stirring	up	the	great	sea_ .	As	though	in	a	movie,	Daniel	 **watched** as	the	north,	
    south,	east	and	west	winds	lunged	downward	and	violently	struck	the	waters.
    a. The	four	winds	that	stirred	up	the	sea	are	possibly	representative	of	demonic	
       principalities	that	 **oversee** the	rise	and	dominion	of	these	corrupt	human	empires.	
       Daniel	10:20
    b. In	prophetic	writings,	the	 **sea** sometimes	represents	the	multitudes	of	humankind.
    c. Daniel	watched	as	the	sea	suddenly	become	 **chaotic** .	What was	happening?
       1) The	churning	sea	shows	how	pagan	empires	come	to	life.	Like	a	tempest	over	
          troubled	water,	they	form	great	cyclones	that	rush	ashore	and	flatten	everything	in	
          their	path.	Psalm	2:1-3,	Revelation	20:1- 3
       2) The	great	seas	of	humanity	have	been	continually	churned	by	the	sinister	winds	of	
          demon-led	empires.	Many	pagan	empires	have	come	to	life	through	the	turbulence	
          of	satanic	 **chaos** .	By	and	large,	these	have	been	antisemitic,	anti-Christian	and	
          godless.	Revelation	14:1
       3) In	chapter	seven	Daniel	explained	how	four	important	world	empires	would	rise	to	
          dominate	the	earth	and	overshadow	 **Israel** until	the	arrival	of	the	reign	of	Christ.
4. Daniel	7:3	– _And	four	great	beasts	were	coming	up	from	the	sea,	different	from	one	another._
    These	four	beasts	that	surfaced	on	the	sea	of	humanity,	are	empires	that	are	personified	by	
    their	respective	 **kings** .	Daniel	7:17
    a. Amazingly,	the	unique	description	given	for	each	of	these	four	beasts	(kingdoms)	
       depicts	characteristics	that	are	also	unique	to	their	respective	key	 **leaders** .	In	the	book	
       of	Daniel,	Nebuchadnezzar	personifies	Babylon;	Cyrus	personifies	Persia;	Alexander	
       personifies	Greece;	and	finally,	the	little	horn,	who	is	the	Antichrist,	personifies	Rome.
    b. These	four	beasts	correspond	to	the	four **metals** (world	empires)	from	the	statue	in	
       Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream.	Daniel	2:31- 35





5. Daniel	7:17	says,	“ _These	great	beasts,	which	are	four	in	number,	are	four	kings	who	will	_
    _arise	from	the	earth._ ”	This	verse	clarifies	that	the	four	beasts	are	four	kings;	each king	has	
    an	 **empire** that	expresses	his	traits.
    a. We	know	the	 **identity** of	these	empires	from	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream	in	Daniel	chapter	
       two.
    b. The	duration	of	these	empires	in	history	constitutes	the	 _times	of	the	Gentiles	_ (Luke	
       21:24).	The	 _times	of	the	Gentiles_ will	not	 **terminate** until	the	inauguration	of	the	
       _Kingdom	of	Heaven_.

**C. Daniel	7:4- 6	 – Three	beasts	rise	and	fall**

1. Daniel	7:4	– The	Babylonian	Empire	rises	(612-539	BC).	In	Daniel’s	dream,	the	eagle-winged	
    **lion** corresponds	to	Babylon.	Daniel	2:38
    a. Daniel	7:4a	– _The	first	_ [beast	or	kingdom]	 _was	like	a	lion	and	had	the	wings	of	an	eagle.	_
       Babylon’s	winged	lion	was	a	multidimensional	 **predator** .	In	the	bird	kingdom,	the	eagle	
       dominates	the	skies,	while	the	lion	rules	in	the	animal	kingdom.	Isaiah	8:8
    b. Daniel	7:4b	– _I	kept	looking	until	its	wings	were	plucked,	and	it	was	lifted	up	from	the	_
       _ground..._ Having	its	 **wings** torn	off	and	then	afterward	being	lifted	again	seems	to	refer	
       to	the	humiliation	and	subsequent	restoration	of	King	Nebuchadnezzar.
    c. Daniel	7:4c	– _...and	made	to	stand	on	two	feet	like	a	man;	a	human	mind	also	was	given	_
       _to	it._ Being	allowed	to	stand	up	on	two	feet	and	given	the	ability	to	reason	like	a	human	
       is	a	reminder	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	restoration	to	 **sanity** and	dominion.
2. Daniel	7:5	– The	Persian	Empire	rises	(539-331	BC).	In	Daniel’s	dream,	the	arched	 **bear**
    corresponds	to	the	Medo-Persian	Empire.
    a. Daniel	7:5a	– _And	behold,	another	beast,	a	second	one,	resembling	a	bear._ The	second	
       **beast** in	Daniel’s	dream	resembled	a	bear.
       1) Bears	are	known	for	their	power	and	 **appetite** .	This	animal	aptly	depicts	Persia’s	
          great	muscle	and	lust	for	domination.	Later	in	Daniel	eight,	Persia	is	portrayed	as	a	
          ram	butting	in	several directions.	Daniel	8:3-4,	20
       2) This	is	the	same	kingdom	represented	by	the	arms	and	chest	of	 **silver** in	
          Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream.	Daniel	2:32,	39
    b. Daniel	7:5b	– _And	it	was	raised	up	on	one	side,	and	three	ribs	were	in	its	mouth	between	_
       _its	teeth;	and	thus	they	said	to	it,	“Arise,	devour	much	meat!”	_ This	beast	represents	the	
       **combined** empires	of	the	Medes	and	Persians.	The	Medo-Persian	Empire	controlled	
       more	territory	than	any	empire	up	to	that	time	in	world	history.
       1) The	bear	being	raised	on	one	side	represents	a	single	empire	dominated	primarily	
          by	 **Persia** and	secondarily	by	the	Medes.
       2) The	ribs	in	its	mouth	likely	represent	the	remains	of	the	three	conquered	 **kingdoms**
          that	constituted	Persia.	Persian	king	Cyrus	had	conquered	and	incorporated	into	
          Persia	the	Medes	in	550	BC,	the	Lydians	in	546	BC,	and	the	Babylonians	in	539	BC.






3) The	bear	was	commanded	to	 devour	much	meat ,	which	the	Persians	did	by	gobbling	
up	 many countries	and	regions	during	their	208-year	reign.

3. Daniel	7:6	– The	Greek	Empire	rises	(331-164	BC).	In	Daniel’s	dream,	the	four-headed	
    winged	 **leopard** corresponds	to	the	Greek	Empire.
    a. Daniel	7:6a	– _After	this	I	kept	looking,	and	behold,	another	one,	like	a	leopard,	which	had	_
       _on	its	back	four	wings	of	a	bird_ ; This	winged-leopard	parallels	the	belly	of	 **bronze** from	
       Nebuchadnezzar’s	statue	and	represents	the	Greek	Empire	forged	under	the	brilliance	
       of	Alexander	the Great.
       1) A	leopard	is	not	as	powerful	as	a	bear	or	as	majestic	as	a	lion,	but	it	is	 **fast** .	Add	
          wings	to	a	leopard	and	you	have	an	animal	that	can	attack	at	ballistic	speeds.	The	
          speed	depicted	in	a	winged	leopard	emphasizes	the	rapid	Grecian	rise	to	power	
          under	Alexander’s	prowess.
       2) The	text	does	not	provide	precise	information	about	the	four	wings	but	historically,	
          under	Alexander	the	Great,	Greece	triumphed	over	the	known	world	after	winning	
          four	major	 **conflicts** in	rapid	succession.
          a) The	Persian	Empire	fell	to	Greece	after	three	decisive	 **battles** in	about	a	three-
             year	time	period: The	Battle	of	Granicus	in	May	334	BC,	the	Battle	of	Issus	on	
             November	5,	333	BC,	and	the	Battle	of	Gaugamela	in	late	331	BC.
          b) Finally,	in	about	325	BC,	Alexander	succeeded	in	conquering a	major	portion	of
             **India** .	He	died	soon	thereafter	(323	BC).
    b. Daniel	7:6b	– _The	beast	also	had	four	heads,	and	dominion	was	given	to	it.	_ Add	four	
       heads	to	this	swift	leopard	and	you	have	an extraordinary devouring	machine.
       1) After	Alexander’s	death,	the	Greek	empire	was	 **divided** between	Alexander’s	four	
          top	generals.
       2) The	four	heads	of	the	leopard	likely	represent	these	four	 **generals** who	carved	up	
          the	empire	after	Alexander’s	untimely	death.	Daniel	8:8,	22
4. Summary:	A	quick	glance	at	history	shows	that	the	prophecies	of	Daniel	7:5-6	were	fulfilled	
    **literally** and	with	pinpoint	precision.
    a. Daniel’s	prophecies	concerning	Persia	and	Greece	are	so	 **precise** that	critics	of	the	Bible	
       claim	they	had	to	have	been	written	after	the	events	actually	occurred.
    b. But	it	is	nothing	for	God	to	know	and	reveal	the	future	in	precise	detail	far	ahead	of	
       time.	God	has	always	known	everything.	If	He	did	not	know	 **everything** ,	He	would	not	be	
       God.	Isaiah	46:10





**D. Daniel	7:7- 8	 – A	fourth	beast	(Rome	or	“western	civilization”	– 63	BC	until	**

**Christ’s	return)**

1. Daniel	7:7a	– _After	this	I	kept	looking	in	the	night	visions,	and	behold,	a	fourth	beast,	_
    _dreadful	and	terrifying	and	extremely	strong;	_ The	fourth	beast	was	a	kingdom	that	would	
    arise	after	the	Greek	Empire.	This	beast	was	the	 **Roman** Empire.
2. Daniel	7:7b	– _...and	it	had	large	iron	teeth.	It	devoured	and	crushed	and	trampled	down	the	_
    _remainder	with	its	feet;_ The	Romans	with	their	 **iron** weapons	tended	to	dominate	wherever	
    they	went.	Roman	armies	controlled	the	world	for nearly	ten	centuries.
    a. Roman	armies	fought	with	meticulous	attention	to	detail.	They	easily	adapted	and	
       consistently	 **updated** their	methodologies.
    b. If	an	enemy	was	successful	against	them	in	battle	using	a	new	tactic	or	weapon,	they	
       quickly	 **learned** and	assimilated	it.
    c. The	iron	teeth	of	the	beast	describe	well	Roman	military	dominance.	Rome’s	armies	
       would	 **crush** the	enemy,	killing	thousands	indiscriminately	and	subjecting	the	rest	to	
       slavery.
    d. NOTE:	This	is	the	place,	right	before	the	description	of	the	horns,	where	the	 **Church** Age	
       fits	in.
       1) We	do	not	come	to	this	conclusion	because	 **Daniel** in	any	way	foresaw	the	Church	
          Age;	it	was	a	mystery.	Ephesians	3:8-12,	1	Peter	1:10- 12
       2) But	there	is	a	time	 **span** between	the	beginning	and	final	phases	of	the	fourth	
          empire.	Christ	came	the	first	time	during	the	beginning	phase	and	He	will	come	the	
          second	time	at	the	end	of	the	final	phase.	The	Church	Age falls between	these	two	
          phases	of	the	fourth	empire.
3. Daniel 7:7c	– ... _and	it	was	different	from	all	the	beasts	that	were	before	it,	and	it	had	ten	_
    _horns._ The	fourth	beast	was	different	from	the	 **previous** beasts.
    a. This	beast	was	different	from	the	others	in	various	respects.	For	one	thing,	it	was	a	
       mixture	of	different **materials** :	iron,	bronze	(Dan.	7:19),	and	clay	(Dan.	2:33-34).
    b. This	beast	had	ten	 **horns**.
    c. Since	horns	grow	on	a	mature	animal	after	the	passage	of	time	(Dan.	7:24),	this	beast	
       will	 **mature** over	time.	The	fourth	empire	will	be	a	long-lasting	empire	with	five	
       discernable phases.	Daniel	7:20,	23
    d. Lastly	an	eleventh	horn,	a	little	horn,	will	grow	out	and	uprooted **three** of	the	ten	horns.
4. Daniel	7:8a	– _While	I	was	contemplating	the	horns,	behold,	another	horn,	a	little	one...	_ Since	
    horns	take	time	to	grow	(Dan.	7:24),	this	implies	that	the	fourth	empire	will	 **age** and	change	
    over	time.






a. In	the	final	stages	of	this	fourth	empire,	in	the	days	of	the	little	horn’s	appearance,	there	
will	be	ten	regional	rulers governing	the	empire.	These	appear to	be	ten	 regional
governments	over	the	whole	world.
b. While	Daniel	was	observing	the	ten	horns	on	the	beast,	a	little	horn	suddenly	appeared.	
This	 little horn	grew	up	after	the	beast’s	other	horns	were	already established.

5. Daniel	7:8b	– _...a	little one,	came	up	among	them,	and	three	of	the	first	horns	were	pulled	_
    _out	by	the	roots	before	it;	_ This	little	horn	will	 **usurp** the	authority	of	three	of	the	ten	regional	
    rulers.
6. Daniel	7:8c	– _...and	behold,	this	horn	possessed	eyes	like	the	eyes	of	a	man	and	a	mouth	_
    _uttering	great	boasts_ .	From	within	the	fourth	empire,	this	arrogant	 _little	horn_ will	arise	
    separately	from	the	previous	ten	horns.	This	little	horn	with	eyes	like	a	human	and	a	
    boastful	mouth	describes	a	 **man** .	Daniel	7:20-21	and	Revelation	13
    a. Daniel	7:19- 20	 – _Then	I	desired	to	know	the	exact	meaning	of...the	other	horn	which	_
       _came	up,	and	before	which	three	of	them	fell,	namely,	that	horn	which	had	eyes	and	a	_
       _mouth	uttering	great	boasts	and	which	was	larger	in	appearance	than	its	associates._
       This	 **boastful** horn	seemed	more	formidable	to	Daniel	than	the	others.
    b. Daniel	7:21	– _I	kept	looking,	and	that	horn	was	waging	war	with	the	saints	and	_
       _overpowering	them..._ This	horn	will	be	victorious	over	God’s	 **saints** .	He	will	oppress	and	
       overwhelm	Israel	and	all	Tribulation	saints	during	the	seven-year	Tribulation	period.
    c. Revelation	13:1	– _...Then	I	saw	a	beast	coming	up	out	of	the	sea,	having	ten	horns	and	_
       _seven	heads,	and	on	his	horns,	were	ten	diadems,	and	on	his	heads,	were	blasphemous	_
       _names._ The	beast	 **John** describes	is	essentially	the	same	as	the	fourth	beast	from	the	sea	
       in	Daniel’s	vision.	The	Antichrist	is	discernable	in	both	beasts.	Daniel	7:7,	19
    d. Revelation	13:2	– _And	the	beast	which	I	saw	was	like	a	leopard,	and	his	feet	were	like	_
       _those	of	a	bear,	and	his	mouth	like	the	mouth	of	a	lion.	The	dragon	gave	the	beast	his	_
       _power	and	his	throne	and	great	authority_ .	The	fourth	beast	of	Daniel,	from	which	the	
       little	horn	comes,	 **combines** all	the	strengths	of	the	three	previous	empires.
    e. Revelation	13:3	– _I	saw	one	of	his	heads	as	if	it	had	been	slain,	and	his	fatal	wound	was	_
       _healed.	And	the	whole	earth	was	amazed	and	followed	after	the	beast;_ The	head	of	the	
       beast	from	the	sea	that	received	a	mortal	wound	and	recovered	will	act	exactly	like	the	
       little	horn	of	Daniel	seven	because	the	beast	and	the	little	horn	are	the	 **same** person.
    f. Revelation	13:4-6	(Read)	– During	the	Tribulation,	the	dragon,	 **Satan** himself,	will	give	
       the	 _beast_ (the	little	horn),	power	to	persecute	the	saints	for	three	and	a	half	years.	
       Daniel	7:25
    g. Revelation	13:7	– _It	was	also	given	to	him	to	make	war	with	the	saints	and	to	overcome	_
       _them,	and	authority	over	every	tribe	and	people	and	tongue	and	nation	was	given	to	_
       _him_ .	During	the	Tribulation,	or	the	days	of	the	 _little	horn’s_ appearance,	government	will	
       sanction	and	mandate	the	 **persecution** of	the	saints.	Daniel	7:20- 21






h. The	little	horn	(Dan.	7:7)	is	the	Antichrist	(1	John	4:3),	or	the	man	of	lawlessness	(2	
Thess.	2:3-4).	The	Antichrist	will	arise	out	of	the	fourth	kingdom	during	its	final	phase.	
Although	he	will	seize	worldwide	dominance	for	a	time	(Rev.	13:7-8),	at	the	end	of	the	
Tribulation	he	will	face	God’s	 wrath and	indignation	(2	Thess.	2:8).

**E. Daniel	7:9- 14	 – A	great	King	arises**

1. Daniel	7:9	– _I	kept	looking	until	thrones	were	set	up,	and	the	Ancient	of	Days	took	His	seat;	_
    _His	vesture	was	like	white	snow	and	the	hair	of	His	head	like	pure	wool.	His	throne	was	_
    _ablaze	with	flames,	its	wheels	were	a	burning	fire._ Then	Daniel’s	vision	shifted	to	a	dramatic	
    **change** of	perspective.
    a. Daniel	saw	God’s	throne	room,	from	which	all	 **decisions** concerning	human	history	flow.	
       This	resembles	the	scene	found	in	Revelation	4-5.
    b. _The	Ancient	of	Days_ is	God	the	 **Father** ,	the	Eternal	One,	who	has	knowledge	of	every	
       event	in	human	history	and	is	uniquely	qualified	to	decree	perfect	justice.
       1) Regardless	of	the	increasing	chaos	of	this	world,	we	can	 **relax** because	we	know	
          that	the	Ancient	of	Days	is	on	the	throne.	Psalm	29:9- 10
       2) We	know	that	history	will	culminate	with	the	righteous	Judge	of	the	universe	
          administering	perfect	 **justice**.
       3) We	can	experience	 **peace** when	we	know	and	believe	that	God	will	fulfill	every	Bible	
          prophecy	in	a	literal	sense.
    c. In	this	throne	room	vision,	heaven	is	setup	like	a	 **court** of	law	and	the	Ancient	of	Days,	
       God	the	Father,	sits	to	judge.
    d. God	the	Father’s	white	garments	picture	purity,	and	His	 **white** hair	symbolizes	the	
       wisdom	that	comes	through	time	and	experience.	Proverbs	16:31,	Isaiah	1:18,	
       Revelation	1:14
    e. Fire	symbolizes	righteous	judgment.	God	is	presented	here	as	poised	to	pour	forth	
       righteous	 **fury** at	the	appropriate	time.	God	will	be	at	work	during	the	Tribulation,	
       dispatching	judgements	on	earth	by	means	of	his	holy	angels.	Hebrews	10:27
2. Daniel	7:10a	– _A	river	of	fire	was	flowing,	and	coming	out	from	before	_ Him...	This	river	of	 **fire**
    may	be	myriads	of	angels	carrying	out	His	righteous	decrees.	The	book	of	Revelation	
    likewise	depicts	angels	fulfilling	God’s	righteous	demands.	Psalm	97:1-4,	104:4;	Hebrews	
    1:8;	Revelation	5:11,	8:3- 5
3. Daniel	7:10b	– _Thousands	upon	thousands	were	attending	him,	and	myriads upon	myriads	_
    _were	standing	before	Him;	the	court	sat	and	the	books	were	opened._ This	seems	to	be	a	
    special	judgment	convened	concerning	the	little	 **horn** .	This	may	be	a	special	court	session	
    before	God’s	throne,	similar	to that	of	the	Great	White Throne	in	Revelation	20:11-15.






a. The	books	that	are	opened	probably	hold	the	records	of	all	the	 deeds the	little	horn,	or	
Antichrist,	will	have	committed.	He	is	about	to	receive	a	verdict.	This	is	an	ominous	
moment.	This	will	likely	occur	just	before	the	start	of	the	millennium,	right	after	the	
Tribulation.
b. Some	of	the	thousands	mentioned	here	are	glorified	 saints and	others	are	likely	angels.
c. After	careful	review,	the	Ancient	of	Days	will	make	a	determination	and	specify	the	
correct	 judgment for	the	little	horn.	Revelation	19:20

4. Daniel	7:11	– _Then	I	kept	looking	because	of	the	sound	of	the	boastful	words	which	the	horn	_
    _was	speaking;	I	kept	looking	until	the	beast	was	slain,	and	its	body	was	destroyed	and	given	_
    _to	the	burning	fire._ Occupied	with	the	 **arrogance** of	the	big	mouth	of	the	little	horn,	Daniel	
    awaited	God's	response.
    a. The	focus	changes	from	the	pageantry	of	heaven	back	to	the	putridness	of	earth.	Sinful	
       **human** government,	under	the	control	of	Satan,	is	about	to	end	forever.
    b. What	caught	Daniel’s	attention	was	the	boastfulness	of	the	little	horn.	This	man	is	
       Satan’s	pet.	Like	his	master,	he	deems	himself	greater	than	God.	He	will	seek	to	usurp	
       God’s	authority	and	preside	over	all	creation,	but	his	boasts	are	 **vain**.
    c. In	the	 **middle** of	all	his	boasting,	with	blasphemies	still	flowing,	the	Antichrist	will	be	
       struck	down.	The	little	horn,	who	is	the	Antichrist,	will	be	judged	and	cast	into	the	Lake	
       of	Fire,	which	the	Bible	calls	the	second	death.	Revelation	19:20-21,	20:10
    d. The	destruction	of	the	Antichrist,	who	will	be	the	last	ruler	from	the	fourth	and	final	
       kingdom	of	sinful	man,	happens	at	the	precise	 **moment** the	feet	of	iron	and	clay	of	
       Nebuchadnezzar’s	statue	are	struck	by	the	stone	cut	without	hands.	Daniel	7:25
    e. So,	we	see	that	the	events	of	Daniel	7:9-11	describe	a	special	heavenly	court	room	
       session	convened	for	the	judgment	of	the	 **Antichrist** ,	and	probably	the	false	prophet	
       too.	Revelation	19:20
5. Daniel	7:12	– _As	for	the	rest	of	the	beasts,	their	dominion	was	taken	away,	but	an	extension	_
    _of	life	was	granted	to them	for	an	appointed	period	of	time.	_ This	statement	is	parenthetical.	
    Though	already	abolished,	 **vestiges** of	all three	previous	kingdoms,	Babylon,	Persia	and	
    Greece,	remain merged	in	the	fourth	beast	until	this	day	of	vengeance.	Revelation	13:2
6. Daniel	7:1 3	 – _I	kept	looking	in	the	night	visions,	and	behold,	with	the	clouds	of	heaven	one	_
    _like	a	Son	of	Man	was	coming,	and	He	came	up	to	the	Ancient	of	Days	and	was	presented	_
    _before	Him._ Daniel’s	vision	shifted	back	to	heaven,	to	the	grand	 **finale** of	all	history, the	
    coming	of	Christ	to	receive	His	kingdom.	Matthew	24:31
    a. The	Son	of	Man,	Jesus	Christ,	will	be	 **king** in	the	coming	Kingdom	of	Heaven.	Daniel	7:9,	
       7:22,	7:27;	Revelation	1:13- 18
    b. This	is	the	first	use	of	the	messianic	title	“ _Son	of	Man_ ”	in	the	book	of	Daniel.	Many
       Jewish	teachers	and	most	students	of	the	Bible	recognize	this	prophetic	utterance	as	
       referring	to	the	promised	 **Messiah**.






1) Jesus	often	referred	to	Himself	as	the	Son	of	 Man during	His	earthly	ministry.	
Matthew	8:20,	25:31;	Mark	2:10,	10:33-34;	Luke	6:5;	John	1:51,	3:13-15,	5:27
2) Jesus	Christ	used	the	title	“ Son of	Man”	to	openly	declare	Himself	the	prophesied	
ruler	of	the	eternal	(fifth)	kingdom.	Matthew	24:30;	Daniel	2:45,	7:14
3) The	violent	reaction	of	the	religious	leaders	when	Jesus	called	Himself	the	Son	of	
Man	showed	they	understood,	but	rejected,	His	 claim to	be	the	Messiah.	Matthew	
26:64-65;	Luke	21:25-28,	36;	Acts	7:56- 57
c. In	Scripture,	 clouds are	often	associated	with	God's glory	and	presence.	Exodus	24:16,	
Luke	9:34- 35
1) During	Israel’s	wilderness	wanderings,	the	cloud	that	went	before	the	people	was	
associated	with	God’s	 presence .	Deuteronomy	1:33,	Nehemiah	9:12
2) The	Shekinah	 Glory that	appeared	as	a	cloud	in	the	Tabernacle,	exhibited	the	
presence	of	God.	Exodus	40:34
d. In	Daniel’s	vision,	the	Son	of	Man	approached	the	Ancient	of	Days.	Here	we	have	two	
persons	of	the	 Trinity shown	as	separate	from	one	another,	proof	they	are	the	same	yet	
separate.	Some	false	teachers	claim	that	Jesus	was	the	Father	in	the	Old	Testament	and	
the	Son	in	the	New	Testament.	This	claim	is	proven	false	in	this	verse.

7. Daniel	7:14a	– _And	to	Him	was	given	dominion,	glory	and	a	kingdom,	that	all	the	peoples,	_
    _nations	and	men	of	every	language	might	serve	Him._ In	this	 **worship** scene,	the	Messiah	
    (Jesus	Christ)	was	give	three	things:	dominion,	glory	and	a	kingdom.
    a. By	giving	Him	 _dominion_ ,	God	gave	Him	the	right	to	rule;	by	giving	Him	 _glory_ ,	God	gave	
       Him	the	magnificence	needed	to	establish	a	throne;	and	by	giving	Him	a	 _kingdom_ ,	God	
       gave	Him	the	sovereign	 **power** necessary	to	impose	His	rule.
    b. The	universal	nature	of	the	kingdom	over	which	the	Son	of	Man	will	preside	is	first	seen	
       in	Nebuchadnezzar’s	dream	when	the	 **stone** cut	without	hands	grew	and	filled	the	
       planet.	Daniel	2:35
8. Daniel	7:14b	– _His	dominion	is	an	everlasting	dominion	which	will	not	pass	away;	and	His	_
    _kingdom	is	one	which	will	not	be	destroyed_ .	Christ	will	literally	rule	on	the	throne	of	David	
    during	the	Millennium	and	onward	throughout	 **eternity**.
    a. All	people	will	worship	Him	and	His	authority	will	 **never** end.
       1) Daniel	2:44	– _In	the	days	of	those	kings	the	God	of	heaven	will	set	up	a	kingdom	_
          _which	will	never	be	destroyed,	and	that	kingdom	will	not	be	left	for	another	people;	_
          _it	will	crush	and	put	an	end	to	all	these	kingdoms,	but	it	will	itself	_ **_endure_** _forever_.
       2) Daniel	2:45	– _Inasmuch	as	you	saw	that	a	stone	was	cut	out	of	the	mountain	_
          _without	hands	and	that	it	crushed	the	iron,	the	bronze, the	clay,	the	silver	and	the	_
          _gold,	the	great	God	has	made	known	to	the	king	what	will	take	place	in	the	future;	_
          _so, the	dream	is	_ **_true_** _and	its	interpretation	is	trustworthy_.






b. Christ will	be	installed	as	Lord	and	Judge	over	humanity	and	all	Creation.	He	alone	is	
worthy.	He	achieved	a	sinless	life.	He	atoned	for	all	our	sins	by	His	death	on	Calvary.	He	
purchased	our	redemption.	He	rose	from	the	grave.	Revelation	4:11,	5:11- 13

**F. Daniel	7: 15 - 18	 – Daniel	is	given	an	overview	of	world	history**

1. Daniel	7:15	– _As	for	me,	Daniel,	my	spirit	was	distressed	within	me,	and	the	visions	in	my	_
    _mind	kept	alarming	me._ It	 **upset** Daniel	that	he	didn’t	understand	the	visions.	In	chapter	two	
    he	had	been	given	the	interpretation,	but	this	time	he	was	totally	mystified.
2. Daniel	7:16	– _I	approached	one	of	those	who	were	standing	by	and	began	asking	him	the	_
    _exact	meaning	of	all	this.	So,	he	told	me	and	made	known	to	me	the	interpretation	of	these	_
    _things:_ Daniel	sought	for	 **help** from	an	angel.
    a. Even	though	Daniel	was	perplexed,	he	knew	who	to	turn	to.	Although	as	believers	there	
       are	many	things	we	do	not	 **understand** ,	we	know	the	God	who	understands	all	things.	1	
       Corinthians	1:30,	James	1:5
    b. Although	Daniel	was	a	mature	servant	of	God,	he	still	had	 **gaps** in	his	understanding.	
       Daniel	had	to	be	taught	just	like	we	have	to	be	taught.
    c. Daniel’s	interpreter	gave	Daniel	an	 **explanation** of	the	things	he	saw	in	the	vision.
3. Daniel	7:17	– _These	great	beasts,	which	are	four	in	number,	are four	kings	who	will	arise	_
    _from	the	earth._ Every	king	has	a	kingdom.	Each	king	shares	similar	characteristics	with,	and	
    is	inseparable	from,	the	kingdom	he	 **represents** .	The	four	beast-like	kingdoms	the	angel	
    described	were	Babylon	(present	then),	Persia,	Greece,	and	Rome	(all	future	then).
4. Daniel	7:18a	– _But	the	saints	of	the	Highest	One	will	receive	the	kingdom..._ Who	are	 _the	_
    **_saints_** _of	the	Highest	One_ referred	to	here?
    a. Living	not-yet-glorified	saints	will	be	present	to	receive	the	kingdom.		These	will	be	
       **believers** at	the	end	of	the	Tribulation	whose	descendants	will	repopulate	the	earth	
       during	the	Millennium.	Matthew	5:3-10,	25:34
    b. Resurrected,	glorified	saints	from	all	 **ages** ,	including	Old	Testament	saints,	New	
       Testament	saints,	and	Tribulation	saints	will	also be	there	to	inherit	the	Millennial	
       Kingdom.	Daniel	12:1-3;	Matthew	8:10-12;	Luke	13:22-30,	22:24- 30
5. Daniel	7:18b	– _...the	saints	of	the	Highest	One	will...possess	the	kingdom	forever..._ Just	as	the	
    previous	kingdoms	were	literal	earthly	kingdoms,	the	future	kingdom	of	 _the	saints	of	the	_
    _Highest	One_ will	be	a	 **literal** earthly	kingdom.	Isaiah	9:7,	Daniel	6:26,	Luke	1:33
6. Daniel	7:18c	– ... _for	all	ages	to	come._ This	kingdom	will	go	on	eternally.	It	will	begin	with	the	
    millennial	reign	of	Christ	here	on	earth	and	continue	on	into	the	New	Heavens	and	the	New	
    Earth.	It	will	never	end. Revelation	20:4- 6	





**G. Daniel	7:19- 28	 – Daniel	receives	a	deeper	understanding.	This	passage	combines	**

**some	review	and	some	new	information.**

1. Daniel	7:19	– _Then	I	desired	to	know	the	exact	meaning	of	the	fourth	beast,	which	was	_
    _different	from	all	the	others,	exceedingly	dreadful,	with	its	teeth	of	iron	and	its	claws	of	_
    _bronze,	and	which	devoured,	crushed	and	trampled	down	the	remainder	with	its	feet—the	_
    _beast that	crushed	and	devoured	its	_ **_victims_** _and	trampled	underfoot	whatever	was	left._
    a. Daniel	wanted	clarification	concerning	the	fourth	and	most	terrifying	 **empire**.
       1) This	fourth	beast	is	 **different** from	the	three	previous	beasts	(kingdoms).	Daniel	7:7
       2) This	beast	is	powerful,	with	frighteningly	large	 **iron** teeth,	destroying,	devouring	and	
          trampling	everything	in	its	path.	Daniel	7:7
       3) This	beast	also	has	bronze	claws,	a	reminder of	the	powerful **grip** of	the	Greek	
          empire had on	its	victims.	Daniel	7:19
    b. As	noted,	the	fourth	empire	has	 **phases**.
       1) The	authors	of	this	curriculum	believe	that	the	fourth	beast,	which	is	the	Roman	
          Empire,	is	still	alive	and	well	among	us,	having	morphed	into	what	might	be	called	
          **Western** or	European	Civilization.
       2) All	countries	with westernized	governments	are	essentially	byproducts	of	Roman	
          thinking.	Western	civilization	as	a	worldview	and	a	political	system	developed	
          primarily	from	 **Roman** logic.
       3) Even	the	architecture	of	many	government	structures	and	the	 **Latin** roots	of	many	
          words	in European	languages	point	back	to	Roman	influence and	sway.
       4) In	this	passage, we	see	that	as	the	fourth	beast	(Rome)	ages,	it	grows	horns.	It	also	
          seems	to	weaken	and	become	brittle,	as	seen	in	the	combination	of	iron	and	clay	in	
          its **feet** (the	final	phase)	of	the	statue	in	Daniel	two.	The	future	uprooting	of	three	
          horns	in	this	passage	likewise	shows	the	volatility of its	final	stages.
          a) Daniel	2:41	– _In	that	you	saw	the	feet	and	toes,	partly	of	potter’s	clay	and	partly	_
             _of	iron,	it	will	be	a	_ **_divided_** _kingdom;	but	it	will	have	in	it	the	toughness	of	iron,	_
             _inasmuch	as	you	saw	the	iron	mixed	with	common	clay_.
          b) Daniel	2:42	– _As	the	toes	of	the	feet	were	partly	of	iron	and	partly	of	pottery,	so	_
             _some	of	the	kingdom	will	be	strong	and	part	of	it	will	be	_ **_brittle_**.
       5) Given	these	factors,	we	conclude	that	the	fourth	beast	will	not	be	destroyed	until	
          the	 **end** of	the	Tribulation	when	a	stone,	cut	without	hands	(Dan.	2:44-45),	
          identified	as	the	Son	of	Man	(Dan.	7:9-14),	suddenly	appears	to	level	it	completely.
2. Daniel	7:20- 24	 – Daniel	wanted	clarification	concerning	the	 **horns** ,	and	especially	the	little	
    horn,	of	the	fourth	empire.





a. Daniel	7:20a	– ... _and	the	meaning	of	the	ten	horns	that	were	on	its	head	and	the	other	
horn	which	came	up,	and	before	which	three	of	them	fell..._ We	already	know	that	the	
fourth	beast	will	possess ten	horns,	three	of	which	will	be	 **uprooted** with	the	arrival	of	
the	blasphemous	little	horn (Antichrist).	Daniel	7:8,	11

b. Daniel	7:20b	– Now	we	receive	new	information	about	the	little	horn.	 _...that	horn	which	
had	eyes	and	a	mouth	uttering	great	boasts	and	which	was	larger	in	appearance	than	its	
associates._ The	little	horn	became	more	 **imposing** than	the	ten	previous	horns.	Daniel	
7:20

c. Daniel	7:21	– We	also	get	new	information	pertaining	to	the	time	when	the	little	horn	
will	 **rule** .	Without	much	doubt	this	verse	refers	to	the	coming	prophesied	Tribulation	
period.
1) Daniel	7:21a – _I	kept	looking,	and	that	horn	was	waging	war	with	the	saints..._ The	
little	horn	will	employ	his	military	to	 **war** against	God’s	people during	the
tribulation.	Revelation	7:9-17,	12:6
2) Daniel	7:21b – _...and	overpowering	them._ The	little	horn	will	have	 **success** against	
the	people	of	God.	Revelation	12:13- 17

d. Daniel	7:22	– Here	are	some	important	 **details** pertaining	to	the	final	outcome	of	the	
little	horn	(Antichrist),	his	war	(during	the	Tribulation),	and	the	start	of	the	eternal	
kingdom.
1) Daniel	7:22a	– The	military	success	the	Antichrist	will	enjoy	against	God’s	people	
will	have	a	 **limit** .	He	enjoys	success	... _until	the	Ancient	of	Days	came	and	judgment	
was	passed	in	favor	of	the	saints	of	the	Highest	One_ .	Revelation	6:9- 11
2) Daniel	7:22b	– Soon	after	the	Antichrist	is	destroyed,	the	Millennial	Kingdom	will	
**begin** .	... _and	the	time	arrived	when	the	saints	took	possession	of	the	kingdom_.

e. Daniel	7:23	– _Thus	he	said:	_ The	angel	gave	Daniel	the	following	 **information** about	the	
fourth	beast.
1) Daniel	7:23a	– _Thus	he	said:	‘The	fourth	beast	will	be	a	fourth	kingdom	on	the	earth,_
Rome	began	its	domination	of	Israel	in	63	BC	with	General	Pompey’s	siege	of	
Jerusalem.	We	have	already	noted	that,	although	Rome	will	one	day	be	 **completely**
destroyed	by	God,	it	has	not yet	been	destroyed.	Daniel	2:35	and	7:22.
2) Daniel	7:23b	– _which	will	be	different	from	all	the	other kingdoms..._
a) While	it	incorporates	many	aspects	of	the	previous	empires,	it	is	going	to	be	
**different**.
b) For	one	thing,	it	is	a	long-term	empire,	as	discernable	from	the	legs	and	feet	of	
Nebuchadnezzar’s	statue.	There	is	no	stoppage.	The	iron	continues	from	the	legs	
to	the	feet	with	only	the	addition	of	clay	in	the	feet	and	toes.
3) Daniel	7:23c	– ... _and	will	devour	the	whole	earth	and	tread	it	down	and	crush	it._ This	
is	 **new** information.






a) The	fourth	empire	is	prophesied	to	trample	the	whole earth .	This	is	something	it	
has	not	yet	accomplished.	This	aspect	is	yet	future.
b) This	verse	states	that	the	fourth	empire	will	subjugate	the	 entire earth.	This	
speaks	of	a	one-world	type	of	government.
f. Daniel	7:24	– After	this	kingdom	has	 devoured	the	whole	earth ,	what will	happen?
1) Daniel	7:24a	– As	for	the	ten	horns,	out	of	this	kingdom	ten	kings	will	arise; After	the	
fourth	kingdom	conquers	the	whole	world,	it	will	be	 divided into	ten	somewhat	
autonomous	nations or	regions.
a) This	is	yet	future.	This	will	be	the	makeup	of	the	fourth	kingdom	in	the	days	of	
the emergence	of	the little horn.
b) Revelation	17:12-13	sheds	additional light	on	these	kingdoms.	 The	ten	horns	
which	you	saw	are	ten	kings	who	have	not	yet	received	a	kingdom,	but	they	
receive	authority	as	kings	with	the	beast	for	one	hour.	These	have	one	 purpose ,	
and	they	give	their	power	and	authority	to	the	beast.
c) Only	 after the	development of	these	ten	nations,	will	the	little	horn,	or	the	
Antichrist,	finally	come	to	power.	This	is	explained	in	the	rest	of	this	verse	–
Daniel	7:24.
2) Daniel	7:24b	– ...and	another	will	arise	after	them,	and	he	will	be	different	from	the	
previous	ones	and	will	subdue	three	kings.
a) This	is	speaking	about	the	 rise of	the	Antichrist.	It	is	what	we	saw	in	the	ominous	
descriptions	of	the	little	horn	in	Daniel	7:8	and	Daniel	7:20-21.
b) The	little	horn	is	a	king	or	ruler	unlike	any	other	(2	Thess.	2:1-12,	Rev.	13:1-8).	
Whatever	he	does	to	overcome	three	of	the	ten	kings	and	control	them	will	
likely	send	a	menacing	message	to	the	others	to	 submit or	face	a	similar	fate.

3. Daniel	7:25- 27	 – Daniel	clarified	what	the	little	horn	will	 **do** and	how	God	will	defeat	him	in	
    the	future.
    a. Daniel	7:25a	– _He	will	speak	out	against	the	Most	High..._ This	rebellious	ruler	(the	
       Antichrist)	will	blaspheme	God’s	name	and	 **defy** Him.	1	John	4:1-3,	Revelation	13:5- 6
    b. Daniel	7:25b	– He	will	 _...wear	down	the	saints	of	the	Highest	One..._ This	evil	ruler	will	
       **harass** and	seek	to	wear	down	the	resolve	of	God’s	people.	Daniel	11:36
    c. Daniel	7:25c	– He	will	 _...intend	to	make	alterations	in	times	and	in	law;_ Daniel	2:21	says,	
       “ _It	is	_ [ **God** ] _who	changes	the	times	and	the	epochs_ .”	This	arrogant	ruler	will	try	to	change	
       the	laws	of	nature,	something	only	God	is	able	to	do.	2	Thessalonians	2:3- 4
    d. Daniel	7:25d	– _and	they	will	be	given	into	his	hand	for	a	time,	times,	and	half	a time._ ...	
       God	will	allow	the	Antichrist	to	be	 **victorious** over	the	saints	for	three	and	a	half	years,	
       or	42	months.	Matthew	24:15-29;	Revelation	12:14,	13:6- 7






e. Daniel	7:26a	– But	the	court	will	sit	for	judgment,	and	his	dominion	will	be	taken	away...
Even	though this	ruler	will	do	these	evil	things,	God	will	intervene	as	 Judge and	will	
pronounce	a	sentence	against	him	and	the	evil	empire	he	controls. Revelation	17:14
f. Daniel	7:26b	– He	and	his	beastly	government	will	be	... annihilated	and	destroyed	
forever. God	will never again	allow	sinful	humanity,	under	the	influence	of	satanic	
powers,	to	rule or	have	dominion.	Revelation	19:11- 21
g. Daniel	7:27a	– Then	the	sovereignty,	the	dominion	and	the	greatness	of	all	the	kingdoms	
under	the	whole	heaven	will	be	given	to	the	people	of	the	saints	of	the	Highest	One;
After	God	destroys	the	beast,	He	will	set	up	the	 Kingdom	of	Heaven ,	and	it	will	belong	to	
the	 people of	God	forever.	It	will	be	a	perfect	kingdom	where	righteousness	reigns.
1) Notice	that	the	arrival	of	the	Kingdom	of	God	comes	only	after	the	destruction	of	
the	final	kingdom,	marked	by	the	 death of	the	Antichrist.	Revelation	14:9- 10
2) This	shows	that	the	Kingdom	of	God	is	not	now	present,	as	many	teach.	God’s	
kingdom	does	not	appear	or	begin	while	the	kingdoms	of	men	are	still	in	power.	
The	Kingdom	of	God	comes	only	 after man’s	kingdoms	are	destroyed	with	finality.	
This	is	a	very	important	detail.	Daniel	7:23
3) The	Kingdom	of	God	does	not	come	about	 slowly over	the	course	of	centuries.	It	
has	a	punctuated	beginning,	as	this	verse	shows.	Daniel	2:44
h. Daniel	7:27b	– His	kingdom	will	be	an	everlasting	kingdom... Unlike	every	kingdom	that	
man	has	inaugurated,	this	kingdom	will	be	 eternal .	It	begins	as	a	millennial	kingdom,	but	
continues	onward	as	an	everlasting	kingdom	in	the	New	Heaven	and	the	New	Earth.
i. Daniel	7:27b	– ...and	all	the	dominions	will	serve	and	obey	Him.’ Amazingly,	after	this	
event,	there	will	still	be	rulers	within	the	Kingdom	of	God,	but	they	will	not	 rebel .	They	
will	not	only	obey	God’s	king,	Jesus	Christ,	they	will	in fact	serve Him	forever.	Luke	1:32-
33,	Revelation	21:24

4. Daniel	7:28	– _At	this	point	the	revelation	ended.	As	for	me,	Daniel,	my	thoughts	were	greatly	_
    _alarming	me	and	my	face	grew	pale,	but	I	kept	the	matter	to	myself._ Although	Daniel	found	
    this	 **vision** difficult	to	understand,	he	did	not	immediately	speak	about	it.

**H. Postscript**

1. Let’s	consider	the	mutating	nature	of	the	fourth	 **beast** and	the	kingdom	it	represents,	as	
    discernable	from	the	book	of	Daniel.
    a. We	understand	that	the	fourth	kingdom	has	five	successive,	distinguishing	 **phases** ,	one
       of	which	is	already	past,	one	is	present,	and	three	are	yet	to	come.
    b. Since	this	is	based	on	deductive	reasoning,	you	might	 **disagree** with	our	interpretation.	
       If,	in	your	Bible	study,	you	find	these	notes	are	inaccurate,	stick	with	the	Word,	not	
       these	notes.





2. Phase	one	of	the	fourth	beast	is	discerned	from	Daniel	7:7	– _After	that,	in	my	vision	at	night	_
    _I	looked,	and	there	before	me	was	a	fourth	beast—terrifying	and	frightening	and	very	_
    _powerful.	It	had	large	iron	teeth;	it	crushed	and	_ **_devoured_** _its	victims	and	trampled	_
    _underfoot	whatever	was	left._
    a. Rome	was	founded	in	753	BC	and	lasted	well	over	1000	years,	until	the	 **end** of	the	
       Byzantine	Empire	in	1453.
    b. Rome	began	subjugating	 **Israel** in	63	BC.
    c. Of	all	civilizations	throughout	the	history	of	the	world,	Rome	was	probably	the	most	
       powerful	and	 **influential**.
3. Phase	two	of	the	fourth	beast	is	discernable	from	the	“ **_legs_** _of	iron_ ”	in	Daniel	2:33.


a. In	395	AD	Rome	 split into	two	empires,	the	Western	Roman	Empire	and	that	Byzantine	
Empire.	Looking	back,	it	would	seem	probable	that	the	two	legs	of	Nebuchadnezzar’s	
statue	represent	this	division	in	the	Roman	Empire.
b. According	to	historical	records,	the	Western	Roman	Empire	faded in	476	AD	and	the	
Byzantine	Empire	dissolved in	1453,	but	we	believe	it	lives	on	and	will	continue	until	
Christ	returns,	largely	because	 prophesy points	to	the	continuation	of	the	fourth	beast	
until	it	is	destroyed	by	God	when	He	brings	in	His	eternal	kingdom.
c. Since	Western	(European)	civilization	has	its	 roots in	Roman	culture,	government	and	
language,	this	is	entirely	plausible.	

4. Phase	three	of	the	fourth	beast	will	be	a	 **unified** one-world	government	and	is	yet	future.


a. Daniel	7:23	- He	gave	me	this	explanation:	“The	fourth	beast	is	a	fourth	kingdom	that	
will	appear	on	earth.	It	will	be	different	from	all	the	other	kingdoms	and	will	devour	the	
whole earth,	trampling	it	down	and	crushing	it.”
b. The	reason	we	say	this	third	phase	is	still	in	the	future	is	because	a	worldwide	
government	has	never	yet	been	achieved.	Even	when	Rome	was	at	its	zenith,	it	did	not	
possess	 all of	the	then-known	world.
c. If	we	maintain	a	literal	interpretation	of	this	passage,	this	whole-world	aspect	of	the	
fourth	beast	is	yet	future.	There	is	nothing	that	keeps	this	worldwide	unification	of	the	
fourth	beast	from	happening	in	our	lifetime.	This	aspect	may	happen	before	or	after	the	
Rapture of	the	church.

5. Phase	four	of	the	fourth	beast	is	also	future,	occurring	after	phase	three.	This	will	be	a	
    coming	ten	nation,	or	ten	regional,	division	of	the	globe,	which	will	come	about	 **after** the	
    fourth	beast	 _will	devour	the	whole	earth	and	tread	it	down	and	crush	it_ .	Daniel	7:23
    a. Daniel	7:24a	- _The	ten	horns	are	ten	kings	who	_ **_will come_** _from	this	kingdom._
    b. According	to	this	verse,	the	 **rise** of	the	ten	kings	(or	the	ten	horns	of	Daniel	7:7-8)	is	
       prophesied	to come	about	after	the	fourth	kingdom	is already	established and	after	it	
       had	already	crushed	the	entire	earth. These	kings	(regional	rulers)	are	yet	future.






c. Revelation	17:12-13	says,	“ The	ten	horns	which	you	saw	are	ten	kings	who	have	not	yet	
received	a	kingdom,	but	they	receive	authority	as	kings	with	the	beast	for	one	hour.	
These	have	one	purpose,	and	they	 give their	power	and	authority	to	the	beast .”
d. “ The	ten	horns ”	does	not	likely	refer	to	the	European	Union	or	the	European	Common	
Market,	as	some	have	speculated,	since	these	do	not	include	the	entire	world.	That	
being	said,	Europe	will	likely	be	 one of	the	ten	kingdoms	over	which	one	of	the	ten	
regional	kings	will	preside.
e. There	is	nothing	to	keep	this	from	happening	in	our	lifetime.	It	may	or	may	not	happen	
before	the	Rapture	of	the	Church,	but	it	must	be	in	 place when	the	Antichrist	comes	to	
power.

6. Phase	five	of	the	fourth	beast	will	begin	with	the	appearance	and	rise	to	 **power** of	the	
    Antichrist.	The	Antichrist’s	regime	will	be	concurrent	with	the	seven-year	Tribulation.
    a. Daniel	7:24b	- _The	ten	horns	are	ten	kings	who	will	come	from	this	kingdom.	_ **_After_** _them_
       _another	king	will	arise,	different	from	the	earlier	ones;	he	will	subdue	three	kings._
    b. The	Antichrist	will	subdue	three	of	the	ten	regional	rulers	of	the	worldwide	government	
       and	take	absolute	 **control**.
    c. He	will	make	this	move	at,	or	near,	the	beginning	of	the	Tribulation.	We	understand	that	
       Church	Age	believers	will	have	departed	by	this	time,	but	if	they	haven’t,	they	will	
       before	he	 **signs** a	treaty	with	Israel,	marking	the	beginning	of	the	seven-year	Tribulation.
    d. 2	Thessalonians	2:3	– _Let	no	one	in	any	way	deceive you,	for	it	will	not	come	unless	the	_
       _apostasy	[departure]	comes	first,	and	the	man	of	lawlessness	is	revealed,	the	_ **_son_** _of	_
       _destruction_.
    e. The	Antichrist’s	dictatorship	will	be	short-lived,	because	he	will	be	destroyed	by	the	
       coming	of	 **Christ**.
7. Final	summary:	The	 **Five** Phases	of	the	Fourth	Beast	(the	Roman	Empire)


a. Phase	one:	A	menacing	 iron - toothed	beast
b. Phase	two:	A	 divided beast
c. Phase	three:	A	 one - world	government	beast
d. Phase	four:	A	 ten - region	government	beast
e. Phase	five:	An	 evil dictatorship	beast





**XI. Daniel	8:1- 27	 – The	Ram	and	the	Goat**

**A. Introduction**

1. The	vision	described	in	this	chapter	came	to	Daniel	around	550-549	BC.	Although	Daniel	was	
    in	Babylon	(present	day	Iraq),	the	vision	took	him	to	an	outpost	called	Susa	(present	day	
    Iran).	Susa	would	later	become	the	 **capital** of	the	Persian	Empire.
2. This	chapter	marks	a	couple	of	important	 **changes**.
    a. Daniel	changed	from	writing	in	Aramaic	back	to	writing	in	Hebrew.	He	wrote	in	Hebrew	
       to	deepen	Israel’s	understanding	about	the	 _times	of	the	Gentiles_ and	to	give	specific	
       information	about	Israel’s	future,	including	some	 **gloomy** predictions.
    b. Daniel	changed	from	a	general	Gentile	perspective	to	a	precise	Jewish	perspective.	He	
       answered	an	unasked	question:	“How	would	the	coming	empires	 **impact** Daniel’s	
       people,	Israel?”
3. Written	in	550	BC,	Daniel	accurately	and	amazingly	predicted,	by	 **name** ,	empires	that	would	
    battle	200	years	later	(334-331	BC).
4. Since	Daniel	wrote	with	extreme	accuracy,	even	naming	Persia	and	Greece,	liberal	scholars	
    who	do	not	believe	in	the	miraculous,	insist	this	was	written	 **after** the	events	occurred.	They	
    believe	it	is	far	too	accurate	to	have	been	written	beforehand.	Evidently,	they	do	not	
    believe	God	knows	the	future	or	that	He	was	able	to	inform	His	prophets	in	advance.
5. This	chapter	also	includes	a	description	of	a	Greek	king	(400	years	before	his	time)	who	very	
    accurately	prefigured	the	coming	antichrist.	Daniel	did	not	give	his	name,	but	we	can	now	
    **identify** him	as	Antiochus	Epiphanes.	Antiochus	Epiphanes	was	a	small-scale prototype	of	
    the	future	global-scale	Antichrist.
    a. The	little	horn	of	the	third	empire	mentioned	in	this	chapter	closely	parallels	the	coming	
       little	horn	of the	fourth	empire;	prophecies	and	descriptions	concerning	the	Greek	little	
       horn	 **parallel** the	future	little	horn	of	Rome.
    b. A	simple	reading	of	Gabriel’s	words	in	verse	19	gives	us	some	important	 **insight** and	help	
       in	interpreting	this	passage.	 _He	_ [Gabriel]	 _said,	“Behold,	I	am	going	to	let	you	know	what	_
       _will	occur	at	the	final	period	of	the	indignation	_ [end	of	the	Greek	empire] _,	for	it	pertains	_
       _to	the	appointed	time	of	the	end	_ [the	end	of	the	final	empire].
    c. We	might	understand	this	as	follows:	The	prophecies	in this	chapter	were	specifically	
       fulfilled	in	Antiochus	Epiphanes,	but	they	also	 _pertain_ to	the	Antichrist.	We	will	show	
       biblically	that	everything	that	is	said	in	this	prophecy	is	true	of	 **both** men.
    **B. Daniel	8:1- 2	 – Daniel’s	second	vision**
1. Daniel	8:1	– _In	the	third	year	of	the	reign	of	Belshazzar	the	king	a	vision	appeared	to	me,	
Daniel,	subsequent	to	the	one	which	appeared	to	me	previously_ .	Belshazzar	co-ruled	
Babylon	with	his	 **father** ,	King	Nabonidus.






a. Two	years	before	this	vision,	Daniel	had	experienced	the	prophetic	dream	of	chapter	
seven.	In	this	vision,	God	expanded	Daniel’s	knowledge	of	the	 kingdoms of	Persia	and	
Greece.
b. God	also	gave	important	information	about	an	evil	Greek	king	who	would	appear	in	the	
latter	days	of	the	 Greek Empire.	This	information	would	be	important	to	the	people	of	
Israel	at	that	time	so	they	would	not	utterly	despair;	from	Daniel’s	vision, they	could	rest	
in	the	foreknowledge this	evil	king’s	reign	of	terror would	be	transient.

2. Daniel	8:2	– _I	looked	in	the	vision,	and	while	I	was	looking	I	was	in	the	citadel	of	Susa,	which	_
    _is	in	the	province	of	Elam;	and	I	looked	in	the	vision	and	I	myself	was	beside	the	Ulai	Canal_ .	
    Daniel	was	physically	in	the	city	of	Babylon	when	he	received	this	vision,	but	he	suddenly	
    found	himself	observing scenes 320	Km	(200	Mi.)	to	the	east,	at a	fortress	called	 **Susa**.
    a. At	the	time	of	Daniel’s	vision,	Susa	was	a	small	fortress	that	had	been	nearly	destroyed	
       by	the	Assyrians	back	in	645	BC.	Years	later,	after	Persia	was	an established	empire,	King	
       Darius	I	expanded	it	and	made	it	the	Persian	 **capital**.
    b. Daniel	used	the	verb	“to	look,”	three	times	in	this	verse	to	highlight	the	fact	that	he	
       **carefully** viewed	and	examined	the	things	God	presented	to	him.	Quite	obviously,	
       Daniel	was	fascinated	by	the	mysteries	he	experienced.

**C. Daniel	8:3- 4	 – A	Ram	with	unbalanced	horns**

1. Daniel	8:3	– _Then	I	lifted	my	eyes	and	looked,	and	behold,	a	ram	which	had	two	horns	was	_
    _standing	in	front	of	the	canal.	Now	the	two	horns	were	long,	but	one	was	longer	than	the	_
    _other,	with	the	longer	one	coming	up	last._ In	this	vision,	God	used	a	 **ram** with	two	horns	to	
    symbolize	Persia.	Daniel	8:20
    a. The	ram	was	a	fitting	symbol	for	the	Medo-Persian	Empire	since	its	kings	wore	golden	
       ram	headdresses,	instead	of	crowns,	when	marching	into	 **battle**.
    b. In	the	statue	of	Daniel	two,	Persia	was	represented	in	the	arms	and	chest	of	silver,	and	
       later	in	Daniel’s	vision	as	a	lopsided	bear.	Now	God	used	a	ram	with	 **unequal** horns	to	
       represent	Media	and	Persia.	The	longer	horn	represented Persia,	the	dominant	partner	
       of	the	two	states.
2. Daniel	8:4	– _I	saw	the	ram	butting	westward,	northward,	and	southward,	and	no	other	_
    _beasts	could	stand	before	him	nor	was	there	anyone	to	rescue	from	his	power,	but	he	did	as	_
    _he	pleased	and	magnified	himself_ .	The	butting	of	the	ram	in	three	directions	symbolized	
    Persia’s	 **conquest** of	the	world.
    a. In	550	BC	Persia’s	huge	armies	pushed	northward	into	 **Media** (northwestern	Iran)	and	
       even	as	far	the	Caucasus	Mountains	just	to	the	south	of	Russia.
    b. In	its	westward	thrusts, Persia	conquered	 **Lydia** (547	BC)	and	a	few	Greek	city	states.
    c. To	the	south	Persia	conquered	 **Babylon** (539	BC),	Palestine	and	Egypt.






d. Besides	the	above-mentioned	nations,	there	were	 other	beasts (nations)	that	were	also	
unable	to	stand	against	the	Persians	because	God	permitted	the	arms	and	chest	of	silver	
to	have	ruling	power	for	a	 season.

**D. Daniel	8:5- 8	 – A	gliding	unicorn	goat**

1. Daniel	8:5	– _While	I	was	observing,	behold,	a	male	goat	was	coming	from	the	west	over	the	_
    _surface	of	the	whole	earth	without	touching	the	ground;	and	the	goat	had	a	conspicuous	_
    _horn	between	his	eyes_ .	As	Daniel	contemplated	the	significance	of	the	ram’s	actions,	a	
    unique	one-of-a-kind	male	 **goat** suddenly	appeared	on	the	horizon.
    a. Without	touching	the	ground,	the	male	goat	aggressively	assailed	from	the	west.	This	
       symbolizes	the	explosive	 **entrance** of	the	Greek	Empire	on	the	world	scene.	For	the	first	
       time	in	world	history,	a	European	empire	entered	and	dominated	the	Middle	East.
    b. The	conspicuous	and	intimidating	horn	between	the	eyes	of	the	goat	personifies	the	
       military	 **genius** of	Alexander	the	Great	in	defeating	the	far-superior	Persian	army.
    c. Daniel’s	vision	of	a	zooming	goat	aptly	depicts	Greece’s	 **swift** eastward	invasion.	What	
       took	Cyrus	of	Persia	twenty-five	years	to	conquer,	Alexander	did	in	less	than	five.
    d. Greece,	the	male	goat	from	the	west,	was	the	belly	of	bronze	in	Nebuchadnezzar’s	
       statue	and	the	winged	 **leopard** from	Daniel’s	vision.	Daniel	8:21
2. Daniel	8:6	– _He	came	up	to	the	ram	that	had	the	two	horns,	which	I	had	seen	standing	in	_
    _front	of	the	canal,	and	rushed	at	him	in	his	mighty	wrath._ The	goat	attacked	in	great	fury.	 _In	_
    _mighty	wrath_ aptly	describes	the	 **hatred** the	Greeks	had	for	the	Persians.
3. Daniel	8:7a	– _I	saw	him	come	beside	the	ram,	and	he	was	enraged	at	him..._ The	goat	was	
    infuriated	with	the	ram.	The	Greeks	held	strong	hatred	for	the	Persians	because	the	
    Persians	had,	on	several	occasions,	tried	(unsuccessfully)	to	overpower	the	Greeks	and	
    **annex** their	lands.
4. Daniel	8:7b	– _...and	he	struck	the	ram	and	shattered	his	two	horns,	and	the	ram	had	no	_
    _strength	to	withstand	him._ Shattering	the	two	horns	appropriately	describes	the	 **abrupt**
    breakup	of	the	Medo-Persian	Empire	by	Greece.	Stunned,	King	Darius	III	did	not	know	what	
    hit	him.
5. Daniel	8:7c	– _So	he	hurled	him	to	the	ground	and	trampled	on	him,	and	there	was	none	to	_
    _rescue	the	ram	from	his	power._ As	you	can	perceive	from	Daniel’s	description,	anger	and	
    **revenge** ,	more	than	anything,	motivated	Greece’s	vindictive	rampage	against	the	Persians.
6. Daniel	8:8a	– _Then	the	male	goat	magnified	himself	exceedingly_ .	Under	Alexander	the	
    Great,	Greece	acquired	a	very	large	 **empire**.
7. Daniel	8:8b	– _But	as	soon	as	he	was	mighty,	the	large	horn	was	broken_ .	Being	large	and	
    multicultural,	the	Greek	Empire	needed	strong	 **central** leadership.
    a. Predictably,	the	Greek	Empire	did	not	stay	intact	long.	Soon	after	conquering	the	world,	
       at	the	youthful	age	of	33,	Alexander	 **died**.






b. Since	Alexander	had	no	legitimate	 heir to	his	throne,	his	death	left	a	dilemma	for	the	
empire.

8. Daniel	8:8c	– _...and	in	its	place,	there	came	up	four	conspicuous	horns	toward	the	four	winds	_
    _of	heaven_ .	With	the	prominent	horn	from	between	the	eyes	broken	off,	four	new	 **horns**
    budded	and	grew,	each	one in	a	different	direction.
    a. The	haphazard	growth	of	the	four	replacement	horns	fittingly	describes	how	the	Greek	
       Empire	divided.	Alexander’s	top	four	generals’	competition	for	 **control** ,	resulted	in	a	
       four-part	breakup	of	the	empire.	Daniel	8:22
    b. We	are privileged to be	able	to	study	this	prophecy	long	after	its	fulfillment.	Looking	
       back	in	 **history** ,	we	can	easily	identify	these	kings	and	their	corresponding	kingdoms.
       1) General	Cassander	gained	rule	of	 **Macedonia** and	Greece	proper.
       2) General	Lysimachus	controlled	Thrace,	Bithynia,	and	most	of	Asia	Minor	( **Turkey** ).
       3) General	Ptolemy	took	 **Egypt** ,	Palestine,	Arabia,	Cyprus,	and	Israel.	(Ptolemy	was	a	
          forefather	to	Cleopatra.)
       4) General	Seleucus	ended	up	with	 **Syria** ,	Babylonia,	southern	Asia	Minor,	along	with	
          many	lands	to	the	east.	The	notorious	Antiochus	Epiphanes	came	from	the	Seleucid	
          kingdom.
    c. Unfortunately,	since	Israel	lay	in	the	path	between	the	Egyptian	Ptolemaic	Empire	and	
       the	Middle	Eastern	Seleucid	Empire,	it	became	a	natural	battlefield	for	these	two	 **rivals**.

**E. Daniel	8: 9 - 14	 – A	Greek	little	horn**

1. Daniel	8:9a	– _Out	of	one	of	them	came	forth	a	rather	small	horn	which	grew	exceedingly..._
    The	little	horn	in	this	chapter	is	different	from	the	little	horn	in	Daniel	 **seven**.
    a. This	little	horn	came	up	out	of	the	 **Greek** Empire	(Dan.	8:9-10).	It	was	not	associated	
       with	the	Roman	Empire	(Dan.	7:8)	as	was	the	little	horn	of	Daniel	seven.
    b. This	little	horn	did	not	 **displace** existing	horns.	The	little	horn	that	will	come	from	the	
       Roman	Empire	will	uproot	three	out	of	ten	horns. Daniel	7:8,	20- 21
    c. The	text	of	Daniel	eight	indicates	that	this	little	horn	will	be	 **limited** in	its	scope	of	
       influence.	The	little	horn	in	Daniel	seven	will	be	universal	in	its	influence.	Daniel	7:23-24;	
       Revelation	13:3,	7- 8
    d. Since	this	little	horn	came	from the	now	defunct	Greek	Empire,	we	can	identify	him	
       from	history	as	Antiochus	Epiphanes	(175-164	BC),	the	eighth	 **king** from	the	Seleucid	
       line	of	rulers.
       1) Historically	Antiochus	Epiphanes	had	a	strong	hatred	for	the	Jews	of	Jerusalem	and	
          persecuted	them	relentlessly.	He	also	sought	to	control	the	priesthood.	In	167	BC,	
          he	removed	the	high	priest	and	installed	an	unqualified	 **priest** in	his	place.






2) Once,	during	a	three-day	rampage	in	Jerusalem,	he	indiscriminately	killed	40,000	
Jewish	citizens	(including	women	and	 children )	and	took	thousands	away	captive.	
(You	can	find	this	history	in	the	non-inspired	writings	of	2	Maccabees	5:11- 14 ).

2. Daniel	8:9b	– The	little	horn	... _grew	exceedingly	great	toward	the	south,	toward	the	east,	_
    _and	toward	the	Beautiful	Land_ .	As	we	have	seen,	this	little	horn	grew	out	of	the	Greek	
    Seleucid	capital	in	 **Syria** .	It	grew	eastward	toward	Persia	and	southward	toward	Egypt	and	
    the	Beautiful	Land (Israel).
3. Daniel	8:10	– _It	grew	up	to	the	host	of	heaven	and	caused	some	of	the	_ **_host_** _and	some	of	the	_
    _stars	to	fall	to	the	earth,	and	it	trampled	them	down_. In	Scripture,	the	hosts,	or	stars,	are	
    sometimes	associated	with	Israel,	especially	believing	Israel.	Genesis	15:5,	22:17,	37:9;	
    Daniel	12:3
    a. This	is	likely	a	reference	to	the	fact	that	God	would	allow	the saints	at	that	time	to	be	
       murdered,	just	as	God	will	allow	the	 **saints** during	the	Tribulation	to	be	overcome	by	the	
       Antichrist.	Revelation	11:7,	12:17,	13:6- 7
    b. Prophetically	this	little	horn	would	bring	much	bloodshed	and	heartache	to	the	
       reestablished	nation	of	Israel,	but	the	future	Antichrist	will	do	even	 **worse** .	Daniel	7:21
    c. We	can	conclude	that	the	Greek	little	horn	in	this	chapter	foreshadowed	the	Roman	
       little	horn	(the	Antichrist)	in	Daniel	seven.	This	passage	graphically	shows	these	
       **similarities**.
4. Daniel	8:11a	– _It	even	magnified	itself	to	be	equal	with	the	Commander	of	the host_ ...	We	
    have	already	established	that	the	little	horn	of	this	 **passage** referred	to	Antiochus	
    Epiphanes.	 _The	Commander	of	the	host_ is	the	God	of	Israel.	2	Kings	19:22,	Isaiah	37:23
    a. Historically	we	know	that	he	put	himself	on	the	level	of	God.	He	minted	coins	with	the	
       words	“THEOS	EPIPHANES”	which	meant	“god	manifest,”	believing	himself	to	be	God
       made	 **visible**.
    b. He	also	sought	to	erase	the	knowledge	of	God	by	burning	all	 **copies** of	the	Old	
       Testament	scriptures	he	could	find.
5. Daniel	8:11b	– ... _and	it	_ [the	small	horn]	 _removed	the	regular	sacrifice	from	Him..._ In	
    approximately	171	BC,	he	erected	a	statue	of	Zeus	in	the	temple	and	sacrificed	 **pigs** on	the	
    altar,	making	the	temple	unusable	for	more	than	six	years.
6. Daniel	8:11c	– ... _and	the	place	of	His	sanctuary	was	thrown	down_ .	Antiochus	Epiphanes	did	
    not	actually	tear	down	the	temple,	but	metaphorically,	by	his	 **actions** ,	the	temple	was	
    _thrown	down_ SHALAK	just	as	he	would	symbolically	 _fling	_ SHALAK	 _truth_ to	the	ground	in	
    Daniel	8:12.	The	temple	became	a	place	for	occult	worship	and	God	was	blasphemed.
7. Daniel	8:12a	– _And	on	account	of	transgression	the	host	will	be	given	over	to	the	horn..._ God	
    gave	this	wicked	little	horn	authority	to	do	these	atrocities	against	 **righteous** ( _the	host_ )	and	
    unrighteous	Israel,	even	though	the	judgement	came	on	account	of	unrighteous	Israel’s	
    _transgression_ (rebellion)	against	God.






a. This	prophecy	would	encourage	righteous	Israel	during	the	future	time	of	great	suffering	
under	Antiochus	Epiphanes.	They	would	understand	that	even	though	God	usually	
rescues the	righteous	from	judgment,	He	had	purposefully	 decided long	ago	not	to	do	
so	at	this	future	time.	Genesis	18:23-25,	2	Peter	2:4- 10
b. During	the	Tribulation,	believing	Israelites	will	also	 suffer with unbelieving	Israel under
the	indiscriminate fury	of	the Antichrist.	Revelation	13:7

8. Daniel	8:12b	– _...along	with	the	regular	sacrifice..._ The	wicked	actions	of	the	little	horn	
    would	put	an	end	to	the	regular	 **sacrifice** for	six	years.
9. Daniel	8:12c	– ... _and	it	_ [the	little	horn] _will	fling	truth	to	the	ground	and	perform	its	will	and	_
    _prosper_ .	Antiochus	would	seek	to	destroy	the	 _truth_ about	God.	This	was	probably	a	
    reference	to	his	efforts	to	destroy	all	 **copies** of	the	Law	of	Moses.	In	his	effort	to	destroy	all	
    true	worship	of	Yahweh,	he	also	installed	unqualified	priests	in	the	temple.	John	4:22- 24
10. Daniel	8:13a	– _Then	I	heard	a	holy	one	speaking,	and	another	holy	one	said	to	that	particular	_
    _one	who	was	speaking	“How	long	will	the	vision	about	the	regular	sacrifice	apply...”_ While	
    viewing	the	vision,	Daniel	overheard	a	conversation	between	two	 **entities** ,	quite	possibly	
    angels.
    a. One	being asked	an	important	question	as	to	how	 **long** this	judgment	would	last.
    b. All	Israel	alive	at	the	time	of	these	 **future** events	would	also	want	to	know	how	long	God	
       would	allow	the	temple	to	be	defiled	by	evil	Antiochus	Epiphanes.
    c. This	conversation	is	interesting	because	at	the	time	Daniel	saw	this	vision	there	was	no	
       **temple** .	It	had	been	demolished	by	the	Babylonians.
       1) Someone	reading	or	hearing	this	prophecy	might	have	speculated	that	Daniel’s	
          prophecy	was	pure	 **allegory** and	could	never	be	fulfilled	literally.
       2) You	would	have	to	have	a	 **temple** in	Jerusalem	for	it	to	be	desecrated	by	a	coming	
          evil	Greek	king,	and	everyone	at	that	time	knew	it	did	not	exist.	Someone	might	
          have	exclaimed,	“How	absurd	to	think	this	could	be	literally	fulfilled!”
       3) There	are	future	prophecies	of	the	Antichrist	going	into	the	Jewish	temple	and	
          setting	up	an	idol	there	(2	Thess.	2:4,	Rev.	13:12-14).	Many	today	contend	that	this	
          can	never	 **happen** because	there	is	not	presently	a	temple	in	Jerusalem	(Mat.	
          24:15),	they	therefore	interpret	these	prophecies	allegorically.
       4) But	the	fact	that	there	is	not	presently	a	temple	in	Jerusalem	does	not,	in	any	way,	
          mean	that	Christ’s	prophecy	about	the	temple becoming	desecrated	by	the	
          Antichrist	in	the	future	cannot	be	fulfilled	 **literally** .	The	Jewish	temple	will	be	rebuilt	
          and	Christ’s	prophecies will	be	fulfilled.	Matthew	24:15
11. Daniel	8:13b	– The	angel	asked	how	long	... _while	the	transgression	causes	horror,	so	as	to	_
    _allow	both	the	holy	place	and	the	host	to	be	trampled._ This	event	that	would	leave	the	
    temple	desolate	would	strike	 **horror** into	the	hearts	of	the	Israelites.	How	long	would	it	last?






a. For	those	believing	Israelites	( the	hosts )	who	would	endure	this	nightmare	it	might	seem	
totally	 unjust that	they	would	have	to	suffer	for	the	sin	of	unbelieving	Israelites.	And	it	
might	seem	like	their	suffering	would	never	end.
b. As	prophesied,	daily	sacrifices	did	end	in	171	BC	when	Antiochus	desecrated	the	altar,	
but	they	resumed	six	years	later	on	December	25,	164	BC,	the	same	year	Antiochus	
Epiphanes	died.	The	reopening	of	regular	sacrifices	is	still	celebrated	worldwide	among	
Jews	in	a	yearly	 holiday called	Hanukkah	(dedication).	John	10:22

12. Daniel	8:14a	– _He	said	to	me,	“For	2,300	evenings	and	mornings....”_ The	counting	of	time	by	
    evenings	and	mornings	is	likely	because	this	time	of	indignation	would	be	hardest	 **felt** in	the	
    suspension	of	evening	and	morning	sacrifices	(worship).
13. Daniel	8:14b	– _He said	to	me,	“For	2,300	evenings	and	mornings;	then	the	holy	place	will	be	_
    _properly	restored.”_ Using	the	ancient	360-day	year	calendar,	2,300	evenings	and	mornings	
    equals	6	years,	4	months	and	20	days.	Here’s	the	 **math** :	360	days	X	6	years	=	2160	days	+	(4	
    months	is	30	X	4)	120	days	+	20	days	=	2300	days.
    a. The	fact	that	the	time	prophesied	by	Daniel	 **matches** perfectly	with	the	historical	record	
       of	Antiochus’	desecration	of	the	temple,	helps	distinguish	between	this	event	and	a	
       similar	event	during	the	Tribulation	when	the	Antichrist	commits	the	 _abomination	of	_
       _desolation_ mentioned	in	Daniel	9:27.
    b. The	Antichrist	will	desecrate	a	 **future** ,	yet-to-be-built	Jewish	temple.	The	 _abomination	of	_
       _desolation_ of	Daniel	9:27	will	happen	at	the	midpoint	of	the	Tribulation.
    c. In	Matthew	24:15	Jesus	repeated	the	prophecy	of	Daniel	9:27,	speaking	of	the	time	
       when	the	temple	will	be	desecrated	by	the	Antichrist.	Jesus	showed	how	that	trial	
       would	 **last** through	the	final	1260	days	(3½	years)	of	the	horrifying	second	half	of	the	
       Tribulation.

**F. Summary	thoughts**

1. A	short	review	of	the	history	of	Antiochus	Epiphanes,	the	little	horn	of	Greece.
    a. Daniel	8:9	– The	little	horn,	Antiochus	Epiphanes,	rose	from	the	Greek	Empire	many	
       years	after	the	 **death** of	Alexander	the	Great.
    b. Daniel	8:10	– The	little	horn	persecuted	the	Jewish	 **nation** severely.
    c. Daniel	8:11	– The	little	horn	concentrated	his	attacks	on	the	Jew’s	 **religious** foundation.
    d. Daniel	8:12	– God	allowed	the	little	horn	to	carry	out	these	atrocities	as	punishment	for	
       Israel’s	 **rebellion** against	Him.
    e. Daniel	8:13- 14	 – God	 **allowed** the	little	horn’s	desecration	of	the	temple	to	last	six	years,	
       four	months	and	twenty	days.	Regular	sacrifices	were	restored	the	same	year	Antiochus	
       died.
2. Satan’s	schemes	are	somewhat	predictable,	being both	subtle	and	overt.	Like	Antiochus	
    Epiphanes,	Satan	tries	to	 **remove** God	from	the	important	institutions	of	our	world.






a. Satan	has	successfully	detached	truth	from	the	public	arena	in	many	nations	by	
portraying	all	mention	of	God	and	His	Word	as	 hate speech.
b. Satan	has	used	the	academic	and	intellectual	elitists	to	attack	and	remove	all	 traces of	
God	from	citadels	of	higher	education	in	most	countries.
c. Commandeering	the	institution	of	human	government,	Satan	threatens	churches	
through	unfair	 laws and	aggressive	controls	over	pew	and	pulpit	alike.

**G. Daniel	8:15- 19	 – Interpreted	and	expanded**

1. Daniel	8:15	– _When	I,	Daniel,	had	seen	the	vision,	I	sought	to	understand	it;	and	behold,	_
    _standing	before	me	was	one	who	looked	like	a	man_ .	The	one	who	looked	like	a	 **man** was
    possibly	the	pre-incarnate	Lord	Jesus	Christ.	Daniel	3:25;	7:13
2. Daniel	8:16	– _And	I	heard	the	voice	of	a	man	between	the	banks	of	Ulai,	and	he	called	out	_
    _and	said,	“Gabriel,	give	this	man	an	understanding	of	the	vision.”_ Gabriel’s	prompt	
    obedience	supports	the	notion	that	the	man	was	likely	the	pre-incarnate	 **Lord** Jesus.
    a. Gabriel’s	assignment	was	to	make	Daniel	understand	the	meaning	of	this	vision.	
       Throughout	Scripture,	we	see	Gabriel	sent	out	several	times	to	 **deliver** important	
       messages	from	God	to	man.
       1) Thirteen	years	after	this	prophecy,	Gabriel	returned	to	explain	to	Daniel	about	the	
          70	 **weeks** (490	years)	of	judgment	decreed	against	Israel.	Daniel	9:20- 27
       2) Five	hundred	years	later,	Gabriel	returned	with	information	for	the	priest	Zacharias,	
          whose	 **son** ,	John	the	Baptist,	was	chosen	as	Messiah’s	forerunner.	Luke	1:19
       3) Six	months	after	appearing	to	Zacharias,	Gabriel	appeared	with	important	news	for	
          the	virgin,	Mary,	about	her	upcoming	supernatural	pregnancy.	Gabriel	announced	
          God’s	choice	for	her	to	carry	and	 **birth** the	Messiah.	Luke	1:26- 38
    b. Gabriel	was	the	second	 **angel** mentioned	by	name	in	Scripture.	Lucifer	was	the	first,	
       back	in	Isaiah	14:12-14.
    c. Michael	the	archangel	is	the	only	other	angel	mentioned	by	 **name** in	Scripture.	Daniel	
       10:13,	10:21,	12:1;	Jude	1:9;	Revelation	12:7
3. Daniel	8:17	– _So	he	came	near	to	where	I	was	standing,	and	when	he	came	I	was	frightened	_
    _and	fell	on	my	face;	but	he	said	to	me,	“Son	of	man,	understand	that	the	vision	pertains	to	_
    _the	time	of	the	end.”_ Gabriel	obeyed	and	went	to	Daniel.	 **Fear** stricken,	Daniel	fell	to	his	
    face.
    a. The	title	 _son	of	man_ BEN-ADAM	which	Gabriel	used	for	Daniel	emphasized	Daniel’s	
       **mortality** .	Ezekiel	used	that	same	title	93	times	with	the	same	emphasis.	Ezekiel	2:1,	
       3:1,	4:1
    b. Gabriel	said	Daniel’s	vision	(of	Antiochus	Epiphanes	and	the	end	of	the	Greek	Empire)	
       **_pertains_** _to	the	time	of	the	end_ .	Antiochus’	behavior	correlated	to	events	that	would	
       take	place	during	the	Tribulation.





4. Daniel	8:18	– _Now	while	he	was	talking	with	me,	I	sank	into	a	deep	sleep	with	my	face	to	the	_
    _ground;	but	he	touched	me	and	made	me	stand	upright._ Daniel	suddenly	slumped	into	a	
    deep	state	of	unconsciousness,	but	Gabriel	was	able	to	supernaturally	rouse	and	instantly	
    strengthen	him	so	he	could	finish	receiving	the	explanations	of	the	 **vision**.
5. Daniel	8:19	– _He	said,	“Behold,	I	am	going	to	let	you	know	what	will	occur	at	the	final	_ **_period_**
    _of	the	indignation,	for	it	pertains	to	the	appointed	time	of	the	end_ .”	These	two	phrases	help	
    us	interpret	the	following	verses.
    a. Daniel	8:19a	– Gabriel	was	about	to	let	Daniel	 _know	what	will	_ **_occur_** _at	the	final	period	of	_
       _the	indignation_.
       1) Any	time	Israel	is	mistreated	by	Gentiles	it	is	referred	to	as	an	 _indignation_ for	God’s	
          **people** .	Lamentations	2:6;	Isaiah	10:5,	25;	Zechariah	1:12
       2) The	vision	Daniel	saw	concerned	the	end	of	Greek	domination	of	Israel.	The	 **final**
          Greek	outrage	against	Israel	was	Antiochus’	desecration	of	the	temple,	which	is	
          what	Gabriel	referred	to	as	 _the	final	period	of	the	indignation_.
    b. Daniel	8:19b	– ... _for	it	pertains to..._ In	this	context,	Gabriel	was	telling	Daniel	what	
       would	 **occur** at	the	 _final	period	of	the	indignation_ (with	Antiochus	Epiphanes)	because	it	
       “ _pertains	to	the	appointed	time	of	the	end_ (with	Antichrist).”
       1) In	essence,	Gabriel	was	saying	I’m	going	to	tell	you	about	X	(the	indignation)	
          because	it	 **_pertains_** to	Y	(the	time	of	the	end).
       2) What	Gabriel	explained	concerning	localized	events	surrounding	the	little	horn	from	
          the	Greek	(third)	Empire	 **mirrors** greatly	( _pertains	to_ )	what	will	happen	on	a	
          worldwide	scale	in	the	 _end	times_ with	the	 _little	horn_ (Antichrist)	of	the	Tribulation.
       3) The	horror	and	indignation	against	Israel	on	a	limited	scale	back	during	the	time	of	
          Antiochus	Epiphanes	 **reflects** what	the	Antichrist	will	do	on	a	universal	scale	during	
          the	end	times.
    c. Daniel	8:19c	– _The	appointed	time	of	the	end_ refers	to	what	we	call	the	seven-year	
       Tribulation	when	God	will	pour	out	His	wrath	on	the	entire	 **world** and	the	rule	of	sinful	
       humanity	will	end	forever.	After	this,	the	reign	of	Christ	will	begin.

**H. Daniel	8:20- 25	 – Gabriel’s	interpretation	alluded	to	the	** **_time	of	the	end_**

1. Daniel	8:20	– _“The	ram	which	you	saw	with	the	two	horns	represents	the	kings	of	Media	and	_
    _Persia.”_ As	noted,	the	 **ram** symbolized	the	two-nation	empire	of	Media	and	Persia.	Gabriel	
    was	specific	in	his	interpretation,	leaving	no	room	for	doubt.
2. Daniel	8:21	– _“The	shaggy	goat	represents	the	kingdom	of	Greece,	and	the	large	horn	that	is	_
    _between	his	eyes	is	the	first	king.”_ The	shaggy	 **goat** here	symbolized	Greece.	This	is	again	
    very	specific.	The	big	horn	between	the	eyes	referred	to	the	first	king,	who	we	now	know	to	
    be	Alexander	the	Great.	He	was	the	greatest	leader	of	the	Greek	Empire.





3. Daniel	8:22	– _“The	broken	horn	and	the	four	horns	that	arose	in	its	place	represent	four	_
    _kingdoms	which	will	arise	from	his	nation,	although	not	with	his	power_ .”	The	four	horns	
    symbolize	the	four	 **generals** who	ruled	after	Alexander.	None	of	the	four	kingdoms	
    ascended	to	the	ruling	authority	of Alexander	the	Great.
4. Daniel	8:23a	– “ _In	the	latter	period	of	their	rule,	when	the	transgressors	have	run	their	_
    _course..._ ”	Gabriel	predicted	that	in	the	last	days	of	the	Greek	(third,	goat)	Empire	the	 **sin** of	
    Israel	would	have	become	so	great	God	would	send	judgment.
5. Daniel	8:23b	– “ _...a	king	will	arise,	insolent	and	skilled	in	intrigue_ .”	The	king	Gabriel	
    predicted	turned	out	to	be	Antiochus	Epiphanes	of	the	 **Greek** (third)	Empire.
    a. Dangerous	and	dark	beyond	imagination,	Antiochus	prefigured	the	Antichrist,	although	
       the	Antichrist	will	take	 **evil** to	even	greater	depths.
    b. Gabriel	said	Antiochus	would	be	an	insidiously	brilliant	 **conspirator** ( _insolent	and	skilled	_
       _in	intrigue_ ).	In	this	way,	he	is	a	striking	prototype	of	the	coming	Antichrist.
    c. We	must	keep	in	 **mind** Gabriel’s	words,	“ _I	am	going	to	let	you	know	what	will	occur	at	_
       _the	final	period	of	the	indignation,	for	it	pertains	to	the	appointed	time	of	the	end.”_
    d. This	description	of	the	final	days	of	the	Greek	empire	 _pertains	to	the	...time	of	the	end_ .	
       Gabriel	used	this	prophecy	to	 **anticipate** how	it	would	be	in	 _the	appointed	time	of	the	_
       _end_.
6. Daniel	8:24a	– _“His	power	will	be	mighty,	but	not	by	his	own	_ **_power_** ...”	Both	Antiochus	and	
    the	Antichrist	would	be	demonically	empowered.	We	know	that	the	Antichrist	will	be	
    empowered	by	Satan	himself.	Revelation	13:3b	states,	“ _And	the	dragon	_ [Satan] _gave	him	his	_
    _power	and	his	throne	and	great	authority_ .”
7. Daniel	8:24b	– _“...and	he	will	destroy	to	an	extraordinary	degree	and	prosper	and	perform	_
    _his	will_ ...”	The	Antichrist	will	 **crush** Israel	just	as	Antiochus	did.	Revelation	13:3b-4	says	of	
    the	Antichrist,	“ _And	the	whole	earth	was	amazed	and	followed	after	the	beast;	...they	_
    _worshiped	the	beast,	saying,	“Who	is	like	the	beast,	and	who	is	able	to	wage	war	with	him?_ ”
8. Daniel	8:24c	– _“...he	will	destroy	mighty	men	and	the	holy	people_ .”	Antiochus	Epiphanes	was	
    allowed	to	hurt	the	people	of	God.	In	similar	fashion,	the	Antichrist	will	be	allowed	to	
    **defeat** the	people	of	God	during	the	Tribulation.	Revelation	13:7a	says,	“ _It	was	also	given	to	_
    _him	to	make	war	with	the	saints	and	to	overcome	them_ .”
9. Daniel	8:25a	– _And	through	his	shrewdness	he	will	cause	deceit	to	succeed	by	his	influence..._
    Through	cunning	and	deception,	the	little	 **horn** leveraged	his	authority	over	Israel.	The	
    Antichrist	will	do	the	same.	2	Thessalonians	2:9-10	says,	“... _the	one	whose	coming	is	in	_
    _accord	with	the	activity	of	Satan...	and	with	all	the	deception	of	wickedness_ ...”
10. Daniel	8:25b	– _...and	he	will	magnify	himself	in	his	heart..._ The	little	horn,	Antiochus,	would	
    be	self- **deluded** .	In	the	same	way,	the	Antichrist	will	lift	himself	up	with	egotistical	
    superiority.	Speaking	of	the	self-glorification	of	the	Antichrist,	Daniel	7:11	says,	“ _Then	I	kept	_
    _looking	because	of	the	sound of	the	boastful	words	which	the	horn	was	speaking._ ”





11. Daniel	8:25c	– “ _...and	he	will	destroy	many	while	they	are	at	ease.”_ On	one	occasion,	
    Antiochus	Epiphanes	killed	40,000	unsuspecting	Jewish	civilians	in	a	 **surprise** attack	on	the	
    city	of	Jerusalem.	The	Antichrist	will	do	the	same	kinds	of	things,	only	on	a	much	larger	
    scale.
    a. Daniel	9:27	– _And	he	_ [the	Antichrist] _will	make	a	firm	covenant	with	the	many	for	one	_
       _week,	but	in	the	middle	of	the	week	he	will	put	a	_ **_stop_** _to	sacrifice	and	grain	offering;	and	_
       _on	the	wing	of	abominations	will	come	one	who	makes	desolate,	even	until	a	complete	_
       _destruction_ ....
    b. Matt	24:15- 17	 – _Therefore	when	you	see	the	abomination	of	desolation	which	was	_
       _spoken	of	through	Daniel	the	prophet,	standing	in	the	holy	place	(let	the	reader	_
       _understand),	then	those	who	are	in	Judea	must	_ **_flee_** _to	the	mountains.	Whoever	is	on	the	_
       _housetop	must	not	go	down	to	get	the	things	out	that	are	in	his	house_.
    c. Matt	24:18- 20	 – _Whoever	is	in	the	field	must	not	turn	back	to	get	his	cloak.	But	woe	to	_
       _those	who	are	pregnant	and	to	those	who	are	nursing	babies	in	those	days!	But	pray	_
       _that	your	_ **_flight_** _will	not	be	in	the	winter,	or	on	a	Sabbath_.
    d. Matt	24:21-22a	– _For	then	there	will	be	a	_ **_great_** _tribulation,	such	as	has	not	occurred	_
       _since	the	beginning	of	the	world	until	now,	nor	ever	will.	Unless	those	days	had	been	cut	_
       _short,	no	life	would	have	been	saved_ ...
12. Daniel	8:25d	– “ _He	will	even	oppose	the	Prince	of	princes...”_ In	his	arrogance,	Antiochus	
    Epiphanes,	the	Greek	little	horn,	desecrated	the	temple	in	defiance	of	God,	the	Prince	of	
    princes.	The	Antichrist	will	do	the	same	type	of	thing.	2	Thessalonians	2:4	says,	“ _Who	_
    _...takes	his	seat	in	the	temple	of	God,	displaying	_ **_himself_** _as	being	God_ .”
13. Daniel	8:25e	– “ _...but	he	will	be	broken	without	human	agency._ ”	The	prediction	here	is	that
    Antiochus	Epiphanies	would	be	destroyed,	but	not	by	 **human** power.
    a. In	164	BC,	Antiochus	Epiphanes	died.	Although	there	are	conflicting	reports	as	to	the	
       cause	of	his	death,	reports	remain	consistent	that	he	did	not	die	by	murder	or	through	
       assassination.	Some	kind	of	 **illness** or	accident	led	to	his	demise.
    b. Similarly,	God	will	put	an	end	to	the	Antichrist’s	life.	He	will	not	be	terminated	by	man.	2	
       Thessalonians	2:8a	says,	“ _Then	that	lawless	one	will	be	revealed	whom	the	_ **_Lord_** _will	slay_
       _with	the	breath	of	His	mouth_ ...”

**I. Daniel	8:26- 27	 – The	aftereffects**

1. Daniel	8:26a	– “ _The	vision	of	the	evenings	and	mornings..._ ”	It	is	important	to	remember,	
    that	although	this	vision	was	a	prototype	of	the	Antichrist	during	the	Tribulation,	it	referred	
    specifically	to	the	 **time** when	the	2,300	evening	and	morning sacrifices	would	be	suspended.
2. Daniel	8:26b – “ _The	vision	of	the	evenings	and	mornings	which	has	been	told	is	true..._ ”	
    Gabriel	assured	Daniel	that	events	would	without	doubt	 **happen** as	predicted.
3. Daniel	8:26c – “ _...but	keep	the	vision	secret,	for	it	pertains	to	many	days	in	the	future._ ”	
    Gabriel	told	Daniel	to	 _keep	the	vision	secret_ .	This	is	best	understood	as	a	command	to	
    preserve,	 **keep** ,	or	seal	up	the	vision	rather	than	a	command	to	hide	it.






a. Daniel	never	hid	this	vision	from	Israel.	It	was	included	in	his	book	when	first	presented	
to	Israel.	Therefore,	we	conclude	that	Gabriel	meant	for	him	to	keep	the	vision	 safe
because	it	was	trustworthy.
b. Because	of	God's	foreknowledge	of	these	events,	Israel	would	be	able	to	take	heart	
when	these	events	finally	came	to	 pass.

4. Daniel	8:27	– _Then	I,	Daniel,	was	exhausted	and	sick	for	days.	Then	I	got	up	again	and	_
    _carried	on	the	king’s	business;	but	I	was	astounded	at	the	vision,	and	there	was	none	to	_
    _explain	it._ Being	in	the	presence	of	God’s	angel	and	receiving	the	astounding	vision,	made	
    Daniel	 **sick**.
    a. Daniel	had	only	a	general	understanding	of	the	prophecy.	Centuries	later	when	the	
       events	actually	took	place,	many	 **details** became	clearer.
    b. We	now	know	many	of	the	details,	i.e.,	the	name	of	the	Grecian	little	horn,	Antiochus	
       Epiphanes,	because	Daniel	eight	has	already	been	 **literally** fulfilled.

**J. Ten	comparisons	between	the	past	Greek	little	horn	and	the	future	little	horn...**

1. Both	were	prophesied	to	 **arise** in	the	latter	times.
    a. Antiochus	Epiphanes	came	in	the	 **latter** days	of	the	third	empire.	 Daniel	8:9a	– _Out	of	_
       _one	of	them	came	forth	a	rather	small horn	which	grew_ ... _exceedingly..._ Also, Daniel	
       8:23b	said	of	him,	“ _...a	king	will	arise..._ ”
    b. Antichrist	will	come	in	the	latter	days	of	the	fourth	empire.	2	Thessalonians	2:4	– ... _and	_
       _the	man	of	lawlessness	is	_ **_revealed_** _,	the	son	of	destruction_ ...	1	John	4:3
2. Both	would	come	on	the	scene	at	a	time	when	wickedness	was	at	a	high	point.
    a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:23a	– _In	the	latter	period	of	their	rule,	when	the	_
       _transgressors	have	run	their	_ **_course_** _..._
    b. Antichrist:	Matthew	24:12	– _Because	lawlessness	is	increased,	most	people’s	love	will	_
       _grow	_ **_cold_** .	1	Timothy	4:1-3,	Matthew	24:37- 38
3. Both	would	be	masters	of	 **intrigue** ,	or	deception.
    a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:23b	– _...a	king	will	arise,	insolent and	_ **_skilled_** _in	intrigue_.
    b. Antichrist:	2	Thessalonians	2:9- 10	 – ... _that	is,	the	one	whose	coming	is	in	accord	with	the	_
       _activity	of	Satan,	with	all	power	and	signs	and	_ **_false_** _wonders,	and	with	all	the	deception	_
       _of	wickedness	for	those	who	perish..._
4. Both	would	be	 **demonically** empowered.
    a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:24a	– _“His	power	will	be	mighty,	but	not	by	his	_ **_own_**
       _power_ ...	
    b. Antichrist:	Revelation	13:3b	– _And	the	dragon	_ [Satan] **_gave_** _him	his	power	and	his	throne	_
       _and	great	authority_.





5. Both	would	be	 **destructive**.


a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:24b	– “...and	he	will	 destroy to	an	extraordinary	degree	
and	prosper	and	perform	his	will,	he	will	destroy	mighty	men	and	the	holy	people.
b. Antichrist:	Revelation	13:7a	– It	was	also	given	to	him	to	make	 war with	the	saints	and	
to	overcome	them.

6. Both	would	cause	 **deceit** and	wickedness	to	increase.


a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:25a	– And	through	his	shrewdness	he	will	cause	deceit	to	
succeed by	his	influence...
b. Antichrist:	Revelation	13:5	– The	beast	was	given	a	mouth	to	speak	arrogant	and	
blasphemous	words,	and	authority	to	 act for	forty-two	months. ...

7. Both	would	be	self-exalting.


a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:25b	– ...and	he	will	 magnify himself	in	his	heart...
b. Antichrist:	Daniel	7:11	– Then	I	kept	looking	because	of	the	sound	of	the	 boastful words	
which	the	horn	was	speaking ...

8. Both	would	take	advantage	of	people	in	times	of	 **peace**.


a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:25c	– ...and	he	will	destroy	many	while	they	are	at	 ease.
b. Antichrist:	Daniel	9:27	– And	he	 [the	Antichrist] will	make	a	firm	 covenant with	the	many	
for	one	week,	but	in	the	middle	of	the	week	he	will	put	a	stop	to	sacrifice	and	grain	
offering ....

9. Both	would	 **oppose** God.


a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:25d	– He	will	even	oppose	the	 Prince of	princes...
b. Antichrist:	2	Thessalonians	2:4	– Who	...takes	his	seat	in	the	temple	of	God,	displaying	
himself	as	being	 God.

10. Both	would	be	 **destroyed** by	God.


a. Antiochus	Epiphanes:	Daniel	8:25e	– ...but	he	will	be	 broken without	human	agency.
b. Antichrist:	2	Thessalonians	2:8a	– Then	that	lawless	one	will	be	revealed	whom	the	Lord	
will	 slay with	the	breath	of	His	mouth ...





**XII. Daniel	9:1- 27	 – Answered	Prayer**

**A. Daniel	9	– Introducing	the	chapter**

1. Daniel	chapter	nine	does	a	wonderful	job	of	drawing	the	Old	Testament	and	New	
    Testament	 **together**.
2. Daniel	chapter	nine	gives	us	a	panoramic	preview	of	Israel’s	upcoming	history	and	future.	It	
    tracks	Israel’s	return	to	Jerusalem	after	Babylon	all	the	way	to	the	 **end** of	the	Tribulation.
3. Daniel	chapter	nine	introduces	the	famous	“70	 **weeks** of	Daniel.”
4. Daniel	chapter	nine	showcases	God’s	sovereignty	and	divine	control	over	world	 **history**.
5. Daniel	chapter	nine	was	written	in	approximately	538	BC,	soon	after	the	fall	of	Babylon,	and	
    during	the	first	year	of	the	reign	of	King	Darius.	For	nearly	50	years	Jerusalem	had	laid	as	
    **rubble** on	the	ground.
6. Daniel	chapter	nine	was	written	about	68	years	after	Daniel	had	been	taken	captive	and	
    removed	from	his	home	city	of	Jerusalem.	According	to	prophecy,	captivity	was	coming	to	
    an	end	and	it	was	now	time	for	Israel	to	prepare	for	a	return	home.	Cyrus	would	soon	
    **decree** the	safe	return	of	the	Jews	to	their	homeland.	Ezra	1:1- 4
7. Daniel	chapter	nine	is	included	and	reflected	in	Jesus’	end	 **times** predictions	found	in	
    Matthew	24-25,	Mark	13,	and	Luke	21.
8. Daniel	chapter	nine	is	built	on	prophetic	writings	found	in	 **Jeremiah**.
9. Daniel	chapter	nine	is	an	 **answer** to	Daniel’s	prayer.	By	means	of	an	angel,	God	gave	him	a	
    precise	timeline	regarding	God’s	plan	for	national	Israel’s	ultimate	spiritual	restoration.
10. Daniel	chapter	nine	hosts	one	of	the	most	profound	 **prayers** in	the	Word	of	God.
    a. Daniel’s	prayer	highlights	the	 **righteous** character	of	God.
    b. Daniel’s	prayer	shows	the	depravity	of	Israel	leading	to	their	captivity,	along	with	the	
       **depravity** of	mankind	in	general.
    c. Daniel’s	prayer	shows	God’s	 **mercy** and	forgiveness.
    d. Daniel’s	prayer	affirms	man’s	need	for	the	 **grace** of	God.
11. Daniel	chapter	nine	will	focus	on	two	primary	practices	of	believers	down	through	the	
    centuries:	the	 **study** of	the	God’s	Word	and	prayer.
12. Daniel	chapter	nine	shows	how	Bible	study	can	and	should	result in	heartfelt	prayer.	It	is	
    one	thing	to	read	the	Bible,	but	it	is	another	thing	to	allow	that	Word	to	stir	us	to	
    intercession.	Prophecy	brought	Daniel	to	his	knees.	How	should	prophecy	 **impact** us?
13. Daniel	chapter	nine	shows	an	engaged	believer	who	got	 **involved** in	what	God	was	doing.





**B. Daniel	9:1- 2	 – Daniel’s	studies**

1. Daniel	9:1	– _In	the	first	year	of	Darius	the	son	of	Ahasuerus,	of	Median	descent,	who	was	_
    _made	king	over	the	kingdom	of	the	Chaldeans_ .	A lack	of	information	from	secular	history	
    has made	it	difficult	for	many	to	 **identify** this	King	Darius.
    a. Daniel	stated	that	Darius	was	 _made	king	over	the	kingdom	of	the	Chaldeans_ .	This	
       appointment	happened	in	538	BC	with	the	 **fall** of	Babylon.
    b. Note	that	King	Darius	was	not	said	to	be	king	over	the	 **entire** Persian	Empire,	but	only	
       over	the	kingdom	of	the	Chaldeans.
    c. Should	we	be	bothered	that	no	proof	has	been	found	in	secular	history	to	prove	the	
       existence	of	Kind	Darius?	No,	because	up	until	1884	there	was	also	no	secular	proof	of	
       the	Babylonian	King	Belshazzar.	The	Bible	has	never	been	 **wrong** in	the	past.	Given	time	
       and	discovery,	archeology	will	probably	one	day	confirm	Daniel’s	statements.
2. Daniel	9:2a	– ... _in	the	first	year	of	his	reign,	I,	Daniel,	observed	in	the	books..._ Daniel	studied	
    the	prophetic	writings	of	Jeremiah.	Why	is	this	significant?
    a. Although	Daniel	was	a	 **busy** and	an	important	bureaucrat	in	the	kingdom	of	Persia,	he	
       took	time	to	study	the	Word	of	God.
    b. Daniel	accepted	the	writings	of	Jeremiah	as	trustworthy	 **scripture**.
    c. Given	the	facts,	it	is	truly	amazing	that	Daniel	even	owned	a	 **copy** of	Jeremiah’s	book.
       1) Since	the	first	copy	of	his	book	was	destroyed	by	an	evil	king	(Jer.	36:20-32)	
          Jeremiah	had	to	write	the	whole	book	a	 **second** time.
       2) Finally,	Jeremiah	was	kidnapped	and	taken	to	 **Egypt** ,	where	he	died.
       3) How	did	Jeremiah’s	second	 **scroll** get	from	Egypt	to	Babylon?
    d. Daniel	clearly	applied	a	 **literal** interpretation	to	prophetic	writings.	Modern	teachers	of	
       the	Word	would	do	well	to	apply	this	principle	to	the	study	of	the	book	of	Daniel,	as	well	
       as	to	other	prophetic	writings.
3. Daniel	9:2b	– ... _I,	Daniel,	observed	in	the	books	the	number	of	the	years	which	was	revealed	_
    _as	the	word	of	the	LORD	to	Jeremiah	the	prophet	for	the	completion	of	the	desolations	of	_
    _Jerusalem..._ Jeremiah’s	prophecy concerning	Israel’s	coming	 **freedom** from	Babylon	and	
    return	to	the	Beautiful	Land	was	finally	about	to	be	fulfilled.
    a. Although	Daniel	had	been	unaware	of	this	prophecy,	when	he	read	Jeremiah,	a	light	
       went	off	in	his	thinking.	He	realized	the	time	had	arrived	for	Israel	to	be	restored	to	the	
       **land** .	The	literal	fulfillment	of	Jeremiah’s	prophecy	was	at	hand.	Isaiah	44:28,	45:13
    b. The	prophecy	of	Jeremiah	required	Israel’s	participation	through	prayer.	Daniel	took	the	
       command	to	pray	 **literally** .	Jeremiah	29:12- 14
4. Daniel	9:2c	– _I,	Daniel,	observed	in	the	books	the	number	of	the	years	_ ... _for	the	completion	of	_
    _the	desolations	of	Jerusalem,	namely,	seventy	years._ This part	of	the	book	of	Jeremiah	was	
    written	to	encourage	Jews	living	in	Babylon	during	their	years	of	 **captivity** .	Jeremiah	29:1- 9





a. Jeremiah	25:11	– “ _This	whole	land	will	be	a	desolation	and	a	horror,	and	these	nations	
will	_ **_serve_** _the	king	of	Babylon	seventy	years._ ”

b. Jeremiah	25:12	– _“Then	it	will	be	when	seventy	years	are	completed	I	will	_ **_punish_** _the	
king	of	Babylon	and	that	nation,”	declares	the	LORD,	“for	their	iniquity,	and	the	land	of	
the	Chaldeans;	and	I	will	make	it	an	everlasting	desolation.”_

c. Jeremiah	25:13	– _“I	will	bring	upon	that	land	all	My	words	which	I	have	pronounced	
against	it,	all	that	is	_ **_written_** _in	this	book	which	Jeremiah	has	prophesied	against	all	the	
nations.”_

d. Jeremiah	29:10	– _“For	thus	says	the	LORD,	‘When	seventy	years	have	been	completed	for	
Babylon,	I	will	visit	you	and	_ **_fulfill_** _My	good	word	to	you,	to	bring	you	back	to	this	place._
1) _When	seventy	years	have	been	completed	for	Babylon_ ... Jeremiah	prophesied	that	
at	the	end	of	the	seventy	years,	God	was	going	to	 _punish	the	king	of	Babylon	and	_
[his] _nation_ (Jer. 25:12).	The	seventy	years	of	Israel’s	exile	in	Babylon	corresponded	
to	the	seventy	years	Babylon	 **existed** as	a	significant	world	power.
2) Daniel	calculated the	seventy	years	starting	from	605	BC. In	605	BC,	Babylon	
defeated	Egypt	and	Nebuchadnezzar	became	king. In	605	BC,	Babylon	invaded	
Judah	and	Jerusalem	for	the	first	time,	taking	Daniel	and	other	Jewish	nobility	
captive	and	carrying	away	many	articles	of	 **gold** from	the	temple.
3) In	reading	Jeremiah’s	prophecy,	Daniel	realized	the	end	of	Israel’s	seventy	years	of	
captivity	was	drawing	near. Therefore,	he	assumed	Israel	would	soon	be	granted	
**freedom** (535	BC).

e. Jeremiah	29:11	– “ _For	I	know	the	plans	that	I	have	for	you,”	declares	the	LORD,	“plans	
for	welfare	and	not	for	calamity	to	give	you	a	future	and	a	hope_ .”	This	verse	is	often	
misinterpreted.	God	gave	this	promise	specifically	to	the	Jewish	 **captives** in	Babylon	to	
let	them	know	He	had	not	forgotten	them.

f. Jeremiah	29:12	– “ _Then	you	will	call	upon	Me	and	come	and	pray	to	Me,	and	I	will	listen	
to	you_ .”	Israel’s	national	restoration	to	the	Promised	Land	depended	on	the	entire	
nation,	including	its	religious	leaders,	 **seeking** God.	Sadly,	the	entire	nation	did	not	seek	
the	Lord	and	therefore	only	a	remnant	returned	at	this	time.	Matthew	23:37- 39

g. Jeremiah	29:13	– _You	will	seek	Me	and	find	Me	when	you	search	for	Me	with	all	your	
heart._ Though	the	entire	nation	did	not	seek	the	Lord	back	in	535	BC,	Daniel	sure	did.	
Dressed	in	sackcloth	and	ashes,	he	 **humbly** fasted	and	prayed.	Daniel	provided	an	
example	for	his fellow	Israelites	in	Babylon	to	follow.

h. Jeremiah	29:14	– _“I	will	be	found	by	you,”	declares	the	LORD,	“and	I	will	restore	your	
fortunes	and	will	gather	you	from	all	the	nations	and	from	all	the	places	where	I	have	
driven	you,”	declares	the	LORD,	“and	I	will	bring	you	_ **_back_** _to	the	place	from	where	I	sent	
you	into	exile”_






1) ... from	all	the	places	where	I	have	driven	you ...	The	word	 all is	key	here.	Part	of	this	
verse	will	not	be	fulfilled	until	just	prior	to	Christ’s	second	coming,	when	 all Israel	
will	finally	bow	before	Him	and	seek	him.
2) From	Daniel’s	perspective,	the	fulfillment	of	verse	14	was	 depended on	their	
participation	in	believing	prayer,	as	seen	in	verse	13.	Daniel	therefore	sought	the	
Lord	in	great	humility	and	passionate	prayer.

**C. Daniel	9:3- 4	 – Daniel’s	preparations	for	prayer**

1. Daniel	9:3a	– _So	I	gave	my	attention	to	the	Lord	God	to	seek	Him	by	prayer	and	_
    _supplications..._ Are	you	too	busy	to	 **study** God’s	Word	and	pray?	Daniel	was	not.
    a. Daniel	was	an	amazingly	important	man	in	King	Darius’s	government,	with	authority	
       over	at	least	1/3	of	the	country,	yet	he	carved	out **time** for	Scripture	study	and	prayer.
    b. Believing	in	the	literal	fulfilment	of	prophecy	did	not	cause	Daniel	to	feel	 **hopeless** or	
       become	lazy.	Prophecy	was	not	a	waste	of	time	for	him	and	it	did	not	nullify	his	
       responsibility	to	pray.	On	the	contrary,	Daniel’s	knowledge	of	prophecy	encouraged	him	
       to	seek	the	Lord	even	more	earnestly.
    c. Bible	study	and	 **prayer** are	two	practices	that	have	characterized	godly	believers	for	
       centuries.	Psalm	1:2,	119:15;	Ephesians	6:18;	Colossians	3:16
2. Daniel	9:3b	– _So	I	gave	my	attention	to	the	Lord	God	to	seek	Him	by	prayer	and	_
    _supplications...	_ Daniel’s	prayer	followed	his	 **reading** of	Jeremiah’s	prophecy.
    a. _To	_ **_seek_** the	Lord	God	was	the	goal	of	Daniel’s	prayer.	 _Lord	God_ was	a	title	that	
       emphasized	God’s	ruling	authority.
    b. Daniel	realized	that	the	 **outcome** of	Jeremiah’s	prophecy	depended	on	Israel’s	positive	
       response.	Deuteronomy	4:26- 30
    c. Jeremiah	29:13- 14 _“You	will	seek	Me	and	find	Me	_ **_when_** _you	search	for	Me	with	all	your	_
       _heart. I	will	be	found	by	you,”	declares	the	LORD,	“and I	will	restore	your	fortunes	and	_
       _will	gather	you	from	all	the	nations	and	from	all	the	places	where	I	have	driven	you,”	_
       _declares	the	LORD,	“and	I	will	bring	you	back	to	the	place	from	where	I	sent	you	into	_
       _exile._ ”
3. Daniel	9:3c	– _...by	prayer	and	supplications,	with	fasting,	sackcloth	and	ashes_ .	Daniel’s	
    prayer	included	 **fasting** with	sackcloth	and	ashes.
    a. In	the	Old	Testament,	fasting	was	sometimes	combined	with	putting	on	 _sackcloth	and	_
       _ashes_ as a	display	of	 **humility** before God.	Leviticus	16:29,	31;	Psalm	35:13; 1	Peter	5:6
    b. Being	seen in	sackcloth	and	ashes	would	also	have	sent	a	strong	 **message** to	fellow	
       Hebrews	of	their	serious	need	to	pray as	well.
4. Daniel	9:4a	– _I	prayed	to	the	LORD	my	God..._ This	marks	Daniel’s	second	of	seven	uses	of	
    Yahweh	in	his	entire	book,	and	all	seven	uses	are	found	in	 **relation** to	this	prayer.	Daniel	9:2,	
    4,	10,	13,	14	(2x),	20






a. Yahweh	was	the	 personal name	God	used	with	Israel	whenever	He	made	a	covenant	
with	them.	Genesis	12:8
b. At	the	time	of	Daniel’s	prayer,	Israel	was	in	captivity	because	they	 failed to	keep	their	
end	of	the	Mosaic	Covenant.
c. Daniel	used	God’s	 covenant name,	Yahweh,	to	remind	God	of	His	promise	to	them	if	
they	confessed	their	sins	and	sought	Him	through	prayer.

5. Daniel	9:4b	– _I	prayed...and	confessed_ ...	God	had	told	Israel	to	 **confess** their	sins	when	they	
    found	themselves	in	captivity	or	exiled	to	other	lands.	If	they	confessed	their	sins	God	
    would	hear	and	bring	them	back	to	the	land.	Deuteronomy	30:1- 5
    a. Leviticus	26:3 9	 – _So	those	of	you	who	may	be	left	will	rot	away	because	of	their	iniquity	_
       _in	the	lands	of	your	enemies;	and	also	because	of	the	iniquities	of	their	forefathers	they	_
       _will	_ **_rot_** _away	with	them._
    b. Leviticus	26:	40	– _If	they	confess	their	iniquity	and	the	_ **_iniquity_** _of	their	forefathers,	in	_
       _their	unfaithfulness	which	they	committed	against	Me,	and	also	in	their	acting	with	_
       _hostility	against	Me._
    c. Leviticus	26:41	– _I	also	was	acting	with	hostility	against	them,	to	bring	them	into	the	_
       _land	of	their	enemies	or	if	their	uncircumcised	heart	becomes	_ **_humbled_** _so	that	they	then	_
       _make	amends	for	their	iniquity,_
    d. Leviticus	26:42	– **_then_** _I	will	remember	My	covenant	with	Jacob,	and	I	will	remember	also	_
       _My	_ **_covenant_** _with	Isaac,	and	My	covenant	with	Abraham	as	well,	and	I	will	remember	_
       _the	land._
    e. Daniel	is	one	of	the	few	people	in	scripture	who	never	has	any	sin	mentioned	in	
       connection	with	him,	yet	here	he	readily	admitted	his	own	iniquity.	In	humility,	he	
       included	himself	with	Israel	as	a	fellow	sinner,	praying,	“ **_We_** _have	sinned	against	You_ .”	
       Daniel	9:8
    f. Daniel	9:4c	– _I	prayed	to	the	LORD	my	God	...and	said,	“Alas,	O	Lord,	the	great	and	_
       **_awesome_** _God...”_
       1) As	he	began	praying,	Daniel	praised	God	for	who	He	is:	 _the	great	and	awesome	_
          _God._ God	is	the	only	 **true** God.	As	Daniel	acknowledged,	“He	alone	is	awesome.”
       2) Daniel	humbled	himself	before	his _great	God_ ,	and	then	he	 **cast** his	cares	on	Him.
          _Humble	yourselves,	therefore,	under	God’s	mighty	hand,	so	that	in	due	time	He	may	_
          _exalt	you_. _Cast	all	your	anxiety	on	Him,	because	He	cares	for	you_ .	1	Peter	5:6- 7
    g. Daniel	9:4c	– “...G _od,	who	keeps	His	covenant	and	lovingkindness	for	those	who	love	Him	_
       _and	keep	His	commandments.”_ Under	the	Mosaic	Covenant,	in	order	to	receive	God’s	
       blessing,	Israel	had	to	keep	God’s	 **commands** .	As	long	as	they	did,	God	showered	His	
       lovingkindness	on	them.





**D. Daniel	9:5- 14	 – Daniel’s	confession**

1. Daniel	9:5	– ... _we	have	sinned,	committed	iniquity,	acted	wickedly	and	rebelled,	even	turning	_
    _aside	from	Your	commandments	and	ordinances_ .	In	this	confession,	Daniel	used	four	
    Hebrew	words	to	paint	a	vivid	picture	of	Israel’s	 **sin** .	Daniel	was	a	young	boy	when	Israel’s	
    sins	reached	the	boiling	point	of	judgment,	yet	in	humility	he	included	himself	in	their	sins.
    a. Daniel	9:5a	– _We	have	sinned..._ Sin	CHATA	means	to	 **miss** the	mark.	This	word	
       emphasizes	Israel’s	failure	as	a	nation	to	accomplish	God's	purpose	for	them,	to	be	
       God’s	hand	of	blessing	to	all	Gentile	nations.	Exodus	19:5-6a
    b. Daniel	9:5b	– ... _we	have	...committed	iniquity_ .	Iniquity	AWAH	means	to act contrary	to	a	
       standard.		This	word	communicates	Israel’s	rejection	of	God	through	their	deliberate	
       **disregard** of	His	righteous	standard.	Jeremiah	2:11- 13
    c. Daniel	9:5c	– ... _we	have	...acted	wickedly_ .	Wickedly	RASHA	means	to	be	 **godless** .	Israel’s	
       conduct	created	social	chaos	and	earned	God’s	judgment.	Isaiah	57:20
    d. Daniel	9:5d	– ... _we	have	...even	turn[ed]	aside	from	Your	commandments	and	_
       _ordinances._ Daniel’s	use	of	 _turning	aside_ MARAD	points	to	their	rebellion.	They	turned	
       aside	from	God’s	Word.	Where	did	this	lead	them?	They	ended	up	enslaved.	You	cannot	
       reject	God’s	Word	without	paying	an	extremely	high	 **price**.
2. Daniel	9:6	– _“Moreover,	we	have	not	listened	to	Your	servants	the	prophets,	who	spoke	in	_
    _Your	name	to	our	kings,	our	princes,	our	fathers	and	all	the	people	of	the	land_ .	In	grace,	God	
    had	sent	prophets	to	warn	Israel	of	the	consequences	of	their	sin.	They	 **refused** to	listen	
    and	change	their	ways.	They	preferred	their	manmade	gods	above	God	almighty.
    a. The	prophets	Israel	rejected	were	God’	chosen	 **servants** ,	commissioned	to	speak	on	His	
       behalf.	Jeremiah	7:25.
    b. Daniel	included	terminology	found	in	Jeremiah’s	book.	This	fact	indicates	that	he	must	
       have	meditated	deeply	on	Jeremiah’s	 **writings** .	Jeremiah	25:4,	29:19,	35:15,	44:4
3. Daniel	9:7a	– _Righteousness	belongs	to	You,	O	Lord,	but	to	us	open	shame,	as	it	is	this	day..._
    Daniel	contrasted	God's	 **righteous** perfection	with	Israel’s	dismal	failure.
4. Daniel	9:7b	– _...open	shame	_ [to	us] _,	as	it	is	this	day—to	the	men	of	Judah,	the	inhabitants	of	_
    _Jerusalem	and	all	Israel,	those	who	are	nearby	and	those	who	are	far	away	in	all	the	_
    _countries	to	which	You	have	driven	them	because	of	their	unfaithful	deeds	which	they	have	_
    _committed	against	You._ God’s	dealings	with	rebellious	Israel	were	clearly	 **justified**.
    a. Daniel	clearly	understood	the	Mosaic	Covenant	and	knew	that	Israel	was	in	captivity	
       because	they	had	 **broken** that	covenant.	Deuteronomy	28:1-2,	15
    b. God	had	made	His	requirements,	as	well	as	the	cost	of	disobedience,	unquestionably	
       **clear** .	
       1) If	they	were	faithful	to	the	Mosaic	Covenant,	God	promised	great	 **blessing** for	Israel,	
          including	health	and	success	in	every	endeavor.	Deuteronomy	28:1- 14






2) But	if	Israel	failed	to	obey	God’s	laws,	God	would	send	 trouble from	every	side.	
Deuteronomy	28:15-68,	Daniel	1:1- 2
3) God	 warned Israel	that	if	they	persisted	in	disobedience,	they	would	be	defeated	by	
the	nations	around	them	and	taken	into	captivity.	Deuteronomy	28:36- 37
c. God	was	faithful	to	 punish Israel	just	as	He	promised.	Israel	brought	about	her	own	
captivity.	Daniel	9:5- 7	

5. Daniel	9:8	– _Open	shame	belongs	to	us,	O	Lord,	to	our	kings,	our	princes	and	our	fathers,	_
    _because	we	have	sinned	against	You._ Israel	suffered	 _open	shame_ BOSHET	( **disgrace** and	
    indignation)	because	of	the	sin	of	the	leaders	of	the	nation	as	seen	in	the	words	 _kings_ ,	
    _princes_ ,	and	 _fathers_ .	
    a. Although	it	was	the	rebellion	of	their	leaders	( _kings_ or	 _princes_ )	and	forefathers	( _our	_
       _fathers_ )	that	brought	Israel	disgrace,	no	Israelite	was	 **exempt** from	guilt.
    b. Daniel had	been	faithful	to	God	but	again	we	see	him	humbly	sharing	responsibility	for	
       the	rebellion	of	Israel.	Thankfully,	our	God	is	a	 **forgiving** God.	Luke	18:13,	Hebrews	2:17
6. Daniel	9:9	– _To	the	Lord	our	God	belong	compassion	and	forgiveness,	for	we	have	rebelled	_
    _against	Him_ ...	Daniel	used	the	plural	forms	of	 _compassion_ and	 _forgiveness	_ (not	reflected	in	
    our	translation)	to	emphasize	the	abundance	of	God’s	 **grace** to	rebellious	Israel.
7. Daniel	9:10	– ... _nor	have	we	obeyed	the	voice	of	the	LORD	our	God,	to	walk	in	His	teachings	_
    _which	He	set	before	us	through	His	servants	the	prophets_ .	Daniel	clarified	that	Israel’s	
    rebellion	was	a	basic	failure	to	walk	in	God’s	 **teachings** given	though	the	prophets.
    a. Daniel	was	now an	 **intercessor** for	his	nation,	praying	for	their	restoration	to	the	land.
    b. He	understood	that	the	 **confession** of	sin	had	to	come	before	restoration	to	the	land	
       would	ever	be	possible.	Deuteronomy	30:1-6,	Jeremiah	29:12- 14
8. Daniel	9:11a	– _Indeed	all	Israel	has	transgressed	Your	law	and	turned	aside,	not	obeying	_
    _Your	voice..._ The	entire	nation	of	Israel	had	deliberately	violated	God’s	 **Law**.
9. Daniel	9:11b	– _...so	the	curse	has	been	poured	out	on	us,	along	with	the	oath	which	is	_
    _written	in	the	law	of	Moses	the	servant	of	God,	for	we	have	sinned	against	Him._ God	was	
    just	in	sending	trouble	on	Israel	because	although	He	had	clearly	warned	them	over	and	
    over	again,	the	entire	nation	continued	in	 **rebellion** against	Him	and	His	Law.
10. Daniel	9:12a	– _Thus	He	has	confirmed	His	words	which	He	had	spoken	against	us	and	_
    _against	our	rulers	who	ruled	us..._ God’s	faithfulness	to	judge	Judah	during	the	70	years	of	
    exile,	proved	His	words	to	be	precise	and	his	warnings	 **true** .	Psalm	119:89,	160
11. Daniel	9:12b	– _...	to	bring	on	us	great	calamity;	for	under	the	whole	heaven	there	has	not	_
    _been	done	anything like	what	was	done	to	Jerusalem._ God	allowed	the	siege	of	Jerusalem	
    and	its	horrific	destruction	as	judgement	on	his	people.	The	book	of	Lamentations,	written	
    by	Jeremiah,	graphically	portrayed	the	horrible	 **consequences** of	rebellion.





12. Daniel	9:13a	– _As	it is	written	in	the	law	of	Moses,	all	this	calamity	has	come	on	us..._ Daniel	
    said that	all	this	judgment	had	been	given	by	God	because	of	their	willful	disobedience	to	
    the	Mosaic	Covenant.	Sadly,	Daniel	noted	that	in	spite	of	the	horrors	of	captivity,	Israel	still	
    was	not	seeking	God.	What	a	 **sad** commentary.
13. Daniel	9:13b	– _...yet	we	have	not	sought	the	favor	of	the	LORD	our	God	by	turning	from	our	_
    _iniquity	and	giving	attention	to	Your	truth._ God	promised	that	if	Israel	turned	from	their	sin	
    and	walked	according	to	His	word,	He	would	once	again	show	them	 **favor** .	Deuteronomy	
    30:1- 5
14. Daniel	9:14	– _Therefore	the	LORD	has	kept	the	_ **_calamity_** _in	store	and	brought	it	on	us;	for	the	_
    _LORD	our	God	is	righteous	with	respect	to	all	His	deeds	which	He	has	done,	but	we	have	not	_
    _obeyed	His	voice._ God	is	righteous.
    a. God **kept** His	word.	He	had	warned;	they	had	disobeyed.	They	had	not	walked	according	
       to	God’s	holy	standard.
    b. God	was	righteous;	they	were	 **sinners** .	It	was	them	who	disobeyed.	God	was	just	and	
       right	in	His	judgment	just	like	He	always	is.	He	is	just	in	demanding	death	for	sin.	
       Thankfully	Jesus	fulfilled	God’s	righteous	standard	for	us.	Deuteronomy	7:9

**E. Daniel	9:15- 19	 – Daniel’s	petition**

1. Daniel	9:15a	– _And	now,	O	Lord	our	God,	who	have	brought	Your	people	out	of	the	land	of	_
    _Egypt	with	a	mighty	hand	and	have	made	a	_ **_name_** _for	Yourself..._ Daniel	reminded	God	of	two	
    things
    a. Daniel	reminded	God	of	how	He	 **redeemed** Israel	from	Egypt.
    b. Daniel	reminded	God	that	His	powerful	deliverance	of	Israel	had	given	Him	an	awe-
       inspiring	 **reputation** with	all	Gentile	nations.	Exodus	7:5;	Psalm	86:10,	97:9
    c. Daniel	wanted	God	to	reassert His	reputation	by	remembering His	chosen	nation	whom	
       He	had	redeemed	and	by	restoring	Israel	to	the land	as	promised.	It	truly	seemed	
       impossible.	Once	again,	Israel	was in	 **captivity** to	the	most	powerful	nation	on	earth.
2. Daniel	9:15b – _...we	have	sinned,	we	have	been	wicked._ Even	as	his	prayer	shifts	toward	
    requesting	God’s	 **favor** ,	Daniel	maintained a	posture	of	humility	by	admitting	Israel’s	shame.
3. Daniel	9:16a – _O	Lord,	in	accordance	with	all	Your	righteous	acts,	let	now	Your	anger	and	_
    _Your	wrath	turn	away	from	Your	city	Jerusalem,	Your	holy	mountain..._ Daniel	drew on God’s	
    righteousness and begged	Him to	turn	His	 **anger** away	from	Jerusalem.	Isaiah	64:8- 12
4. Daniel	9:16b – _...for	because	of	our	sins	and	the	iniquities	of	our	fathers,	Jerusalem	and	Your	_
    _people	have	become	a	reproach	to	all	those	around	us._ Daniel	admitted	that	by	their	sin	
    Israel	had	ruined	their	reputation	in	the	world.	He	appealed	to	God’s	 **grace**.
5. Daniel	9:17	– _So	now,	our	God,	listen	to	the	prayer	of	Your	servant	and	to	his	supplications,	_
    _and	for	Your	sake,	O	Lord,	let	Your	face	shine	on	Your	desolate	sanctuary_ .	Daniel	cried	out	
    for	the	resurgence	of God’s	 **glory** ,	asking	God	to	show	favor	to	His _desolate	sanctuary_.





6. Daniel	9:18a – _O	my	God,	incline	Your	ear	and	hear!	Open	Your	eyes	and	see	our	desolations	_
    _and	the	city	which	is	called	by	Your	name..._ Daniel	continued	to	appeal	to	God’s	reputation	
    as	he	begged	God	to	give	 **attention** to	his	request	for	the	city	that	still	bore	His	name.
7. Daniel	9:18b – _...for	we	are	not	presenting	our	supplications	before	You	on	account	of	any	_
    _merits	of	our	own,	but	on	account	of	Your	great	compassion._ Daniel	understood	his	personal	
    unworthiness	to	even	approach	God	with	petitions.	Therefore,	he	appealed	to	God’s	 **grace**
    and	tender	compassion.
8. Daniel	9:19a	– _O	Lord,	hear!	O	Lord,	forgive!	O	Lord,	listen	and	take	action!	_ Daniel prayed	
    passionately;	he	begged	God	to	take	 **action** .	Psalm	141:1- 2
9. Daniel	9:19b	– _For	Your	own	sake,	O	my	God,	do	not	delay,	because	Your	city	and	Your	_
    _people	are	called	by	Your	name._ Daniel	kept	reminding	God	that	it	was	to	His	advantage	to	
    answer	since	His	 **glory** was	at	stake,	after	all,	Israel	and	Jerusalem	were	inseparably	
    attached	to	His name.

**F. Daniel	9:20- 23	 – Daniel’s	prayer	answered**

1. Daniel	9:20	– _Now	while	I	was	speaking	and	praying,	and	confessing	my	sin	and	the	sin	of	_
    _my	people	Israel,	and	presenting	my	supplication	before	the	LORD	my	God	in	behalf	of	the	_
    _holy	mountain	of	my	God..._ Daniel	had	just	begged	God	to	 **quickly** answer,	saying,	“ _O	my	_
    _God,	do	not	delay.”_
    a. Daniel	had	petitioned	God	specifically	for	Jerusalem	(Dan.	9:18),	for	Israel	(Dan.	9:20)	
       and	for	the	restoration of	the	 **temple** (Dan.	9:17).
    b. These	issues	will	be	critical	for	understanding	God’s	 **answer** for	Daniel	in	Daniel	9:24-27.
2. Daniel	9:21a	– _while	I	was	still	speaking in	prayer,	then	the	man	Gabriel,	whom	I	had	seen	in	_
    _the	vision	previously,	came	to	me..._ Suddenly,	in	the	middle	of	Daniel’s	prayer,	 **Gabriel**
    arrived	with	an	answer.
    a. This	is	Daniel’s	second	encounter	with	Gabriel.	Gabriel	had	spoken	to	him	in	an	earlier	
       **vision** .	Daniel	8:15- 16
    b. Was	Gabriel	a	man	or	an	angel?	He	was	an	angel.	The	Hebrew	word	for	 _man_ ISH	is	a	
       **broad** term	that	can	be	translated	man,	warrior	or	servant,	just	to	name	a	few.
3. Daniel	9:21	– _...Gabriel	...came	to	me	in	my	extreme	weariness	about	the	time	of	the	evening	_
    _offering._ Daniel	noted	his	extremely	weakened	physical	condition,	probably	the	result	of	
    fasting	and	intense	prayer.	Using	a	Jewish	method	of	keeping	time,	Daniel	referred	to	 _the	_
    _time	of	the	evening	offering_ ,	which	would	have	been	around	three	in	the	 **afternoon**.
4. Daniel	9:22	– _He	gave	me	instruction	and	talked	with	me	and	said,	“O	Daniel,	I	have	now	_
    _come	forth	to	give	you	insight	with	understanding_ .	God	designed	Gabriel’s	message	to	 **fill**
    crucial	gaps	in	Daniel’s	understanding	of	the	 _times	of	the	Gentiles_ and	the	end	times.





5. Daniel	9:23	– _At	the	beginning	of	your	supplications	the	command	was	issued,	and	I	have	_
    _come	to	tell	you,	for	you	are	highly	esteemed;	so	give	heed	to	the	message	and	gain	_
    _understanding	of	the	vision._ The	word	 _highly	esteemed_ CHAMODOT	means	 **precious** to	God.	
    God	sent	Gabriel	to	Daniel	for	two	reasons.
    a. First,	he	came	as	an	 **answer** to	Daniel’s	prayer.
    b. Second,	he	came	to	give	Daniel	prophetic	 **insight** into	Israel’s	impending	remedial	
       judgment	that	would	come	during	the	remainder	of	the	 _times	of	the	gentiles_.

**G. Daniel	9:24- 27	 – Daniel’s	seventy	sevens**

1. Introduction	to	this	section
    a. This	is	one	of	the	most	important	prophecies	in	the	Old	Testament.	It	is	often	called	the	
       “ **seventy** weeks	of	Daniel,”	but	it	would	be	better	called	the	“seventy	sevens	of	Daniel.”
    b. Daniel	had	just	prayed,	confessing	Israel’s	sin,	but	not	all	Israelites	everywhere	were	at	
       Daniel’s	level	of	brokenness.	Indeed,	even	now	most	of	Israel	is	not	 **broken** and	ready	to	
       trust	in	and	welcome	Jesus	of	Nazareth	as	their	Messiah.
       1) This	prophecy	includes	information	about	the	upcoming	restoration	of	Jerusalem	
          and	the	temple	and	also	about	 **another** future	destruction	of	both	Jerusalem	and	
          the	temple.
       2) This	prophecy	includes	information	about	the	coming	sad	 **rejection** of	Christ	in	His	
          First	Advent.
       3) This	prophecy	includes	information	about	the	coming	 **Antichrist**.
       4) This	prophecy	is	 **specific** to	Israel.	The	Gentiles	had	already	received	their	program	
          details	in	Daniel	2	and	Daniel	7.
2. Daniel	9:24a	– _Seventy	weeks	have	been	decreed..._ Are	these	seventy	weeks	literal	seven-
    day	weeks	(490	days)?	No,	the	context	will	show	a	much	 **longer** period	of	time.	These	 _weeks_
    are	seven	year	weeks.
    a. The	word	for	 _weeks	_ SHABUA	signifies	a	 **unit** of	seven,	not	exclusively	a	seven-day	week.	
       It	functions	like	the	word	dozen.	A	dozen is	any	group	of	twelve.
    b. As	we	move	through	this	passage,	we	will	see	that	the	angel	Gabriel	is	speaking	of	70	
       sets	of	7	years,	totaling	490	 **years**.
    c. Why	count	by	sets	of	seven?	Israel	was just	finishing	a	seventy-year	period	of	discipline,	
       as	seen	in	Daniel	9:1-2.	Sadly,	Daniel	was	told	the	nation	would	suffer	seven	times	as	
       much	judgment	as	they	had	just	faced.	The	490	years	of	remedial	 **judgment** under	the	
       weightiness	of	Gentile	dominion	was	decreed	and	still	to	come.
3. Daniel	9:24b	– _Seventy	weeks	have	been	decreed	for	your	people	and	your	holy	city..._ When	
    Gabriel	says	to	Daniel	 _your	people_ and	 _your	city_ ,	he	was referring	to	the	 **Jews** and	Jerusalem	
    respectively. He	was not	referring	to	the	Gentiles	or	to	the	Church	of	Jesus	Christ.	
    1	Corinthians	10:32






a. Daniel	had	just	prayed	for	a	literal	 return of	Israel	to	the	land	and	a	literal	restoration	of	
Jerusalem.	In	response	to	his	prayer,	Gabriel	suddenly	appeared	bringing	news	as	to	
how	God	would	accomplish	Israel’s	true	and	complete	restoration.	Daniel	9:20
b. A	verdict	of	490	years	of	discipline	had	been	 decreed by	God.	This	means	the	remedial	
discipline	was	decided,	 determined and	set	aside	by	God.	God	had	marked	off	this	
period	of	time	for	Israel’s	ultimate	restoration,	and	it	would	not	change.

4. Daniel	9:24c	– There	are	six	 **purposes** given	here	for	national	Israel’s	required	suffering	of	
    the	70	weeks	of	seven	year	judgments	(490	years).
    a. Purpose	#1	– ... _to	finish	the	transgression..._ The	first	purpose	God	had	in	mind	for	Israel’s	
       490 - year	discipline	was	to	finish,	or	bring	to	an	end,	or	put	a	stop	to,	her	transgression	
       in	the	form	of	 **rebellion** against	God.	The	490	years	will	make	an	end	of	Israel’s	defiance.
       1) Clearly	their	rejection	of	Jesus	as	 **Messiah** was	Israel’s	greatest	transgression.
       2) At	Christ’s	Second	Coming,	national	Israel	will	finally	be	broken	and	 **done** with	her	
          rebellion, just	as	stated	in	this	first	purpose.	Isaiah	53:1-9,	Zechariah	12:10-13:1
    b. Purpose	#2	– ... _to	make	an	end	of	sin..._ The	purpose	for	the	490	years	of	judgment	was	
       to	make	an	end	of	 **_sin_**.
       1) The	word	 _sin_ is	plural	in	Hebrew	and	it	likely	refers	to	the	nation’s	sins	as	historically	
          reflected	in	their	 **idolatry** .	Zechariah	5:1- 10
       2) An	 _end	of	sin_ will	be	accomplished	when	this	period	of	490	years	is	completed.	The	
          word	 _end_ CHATHAM	is	the	same	word	translated	 _to	seal	up	_ in	this	same	verse.	
          When	a	message	was	completed,	the	scroll	would	be	rolled	up	and	 **sealed** .	This	
          meant	nothing	could	be	added	or	removed.	Romans	11:27
       3) Israel’s idolatries	will	cease	when	all	490	years	of	decreed	 **discipline** are	completed.	
          Jeremiah	31:31- 34
    c. Purpose	#3	– ... _to	make	atonement	for	iniquity..._ The	490	years	of	discipline	will	 **satisfy**
       God’s	requirements	for	Israel’s	chastisement for sin,	making	it	possible for	their	broken	
       relationship	with	God	to	be	restored.	Leviticus	1:3-4,	23:26-32;	Ezekiel	36:25-38;	39:25-
       29;	Daniel	12:11- 12
    d. Purpose	#4	– ... _to	bring	in	everlasting	righteousness..._ The	490	years	are	designed	to	
       bring	in	a	righteousness	that	lasts	forever.	The	ushering	in	of	an	age	of	everlasting	
       righteousness	refers	to	the	Millennial	 **Kingdom** ,	which	will	be	welcomed	by	Israel	with	
       great	gusto	at	the	end	of	the	490	years	of	decreed	judgment.	Revelation	20:1- 9
    e. Purpose	#5	– ... _to	seal	up	vision	and	prophecy..._ We	see	that	when	the	490	years	are	
       completed, at	the	 **end** of	the	Tribulation,	all	discipline	of	Israel	will	cease.	All	the	
       prophecies	that	foretold	Israel’s	sufferings	at	the	hand	of	the	Gentiles	will	be	rolled	up	
       and	completed.






f. Purpose	#6	– ... and	to	anoint	the	most	holy	place... At	the	end	of	this	490	years,	all	
obstacles	will	have	been	removed	so	that	the	temple	mount	can	be	dedicated	and	the	
millennial	temple	constructed.	During	the	Millennium,	the	entire	 world will	worship	the	
Lord	Jesus	Christ	at	the	temple.	Ezekiel	40- 48
g. Here	are	nine	important	 observations about	these	six	purposes.
1) All	six	purposes	can	be	achieved	only	through	the	decreed	490	years	of	severe	
discipline.
2) All	six	purposes	have	the	idea	of	 completion ,	or	accomplished	finality,	built	into	
them.	(to	finish,	to	end,	to	bring	in	everlasting...,	to	seal	up,	to	anoint).
3) All	six	purposes	result	in	 blessings ,	not	curses.	They	speak	of	the	end	of	sin	and	the	
beginning	of	eternal	righteousness.
4) The	490	years	must	run	their	 full course.	Already,	483	years	have	passed.	The	seven	
years	that	remain	are	the	toughest	of	all.
5) Each	of	the	six	purposes	falls	into	one	of	two	categories,	it	either	brings	an	end	to	
sin	or	it	brings	in	 righteousness ;	all	six	will	bring	about	the	national	purification	of	
Israel.
6) All	six	purposes	are	exclusively	for	Israel.	The	church	is	nowhere	present	in	this	
prophecy.	This	prophecy	is	Israel	specific.	Gabriel	stated	emphatically,	 “Seventy	
weeks	have	been	decreed	for	 your people	and	your	holy	city .”
7) All	six	purposes	reflect	the	 New Covenant	God	promised	to	establish	with	Israel.	At	
the	end	of	these	490	years,	God	will	establish	the	New	Covenant	with	Israel.	
Jeremiah	31:31- 34
8) All	six	purposes	are	designed	to	prepare	Israel	to	finally,	by	faith,	 welcome their	
Messiah.	When	the	490-year	decreed	discipline	ends,	Israel	will	be	humbled,	
believing,	and	mourning	at	the	arrival	of	Jesus	of	Nazareth,	as	Savior	and	King.	
Matthew	23:37-39,	Zechariah	12:10-14,	Revelation	1:7
9) All	six	purposes	are	designed	to	usher	Israel	into	the	Messianic	 Kingdom.

5. Daniel	9:25a	– _So	you	are	to	know	and	discern..._ The	word	 **_discern_** SAKAL	means	to	have	the	
    capacity	to	understand. God	wanted	Daniel	to	know	and	understand	this	message.	Israel	
    should	have	known	the	timeline	of	this	prophecy	just	as	we	do	today.
6. Daniel	9:25b	– Gabriel’s	message	tells	us	how	the	seventy	 **sets** of	seven	years	(490	years)	
    will	begin.	 _So	you	are	to	know	and	discern	that	from	the	issuing	of	a	decree	to	restore	and	_
    _rebuild	Jerusalem..._
    a. Gabriel	stated	that	the	timeline	for	the	490	years	would	begin	with	a	decree	to	 **rebuild**
       Jerusalem.	The	timeline	did	not	begin	with	the	decree	to	rebuild	the	temple.
       1) In	Ezra	1:1-4, **Cyrus** decreed	the	rebuilding	of	the	temple.	This	occurred	in	538	BC.
       2) In	Ezra	6:1- 1 2, Cyrus	issued	a	second	decree	reconfirming	his	edict	to	rebuild	the	
          **temple** in	Jerusalem.	This	occurred	in	512	BC.






3) In	Ezra	7:11-26, Artaxerxes	made	a	decree	to	renew	 sacrifices to	God.	This	occurred	
in	457	BC.
4) Finally, on	March	5,	444	BC,	Artaxerxes	issued	the	decree	that	allowed	for	the	
rebuilding	of	the	broken-down	 walls of	Jerusalem	as	Nehemiah	had	described	in	
Nehemiah	2:1-8.	This	is	the	only	decree	that	fits	the	literal	details	of	Gabriel’s	
message.
b. Artaxerxes’	decree	to	rebuild	Jerusalem	was	the	 starting point	of	the	seventy	weeks	of	
seven.	According	to	Gabriel,	Messiah	the	Prince	would	come	on	the	scene	at	the	end	of	
sixty-nine	weeks	of	seven.

7. Daniel	9:25c	– _So	you	are	to	know	and	discern	that	from	the	issuing	of	a	decree	to	restore	_
    _and	rebuild	Jerusalem	until	Messiah	the	Prince..._ Who	is	Messiah	the **Prince**?
    a. This	refers	to	none	other	than	Jesus	 **Christ** of	Nazareth.	Interestingly,	Gabriel	did	not	
       refer	to	Him	as	Messiah	the	King	because	only	a	small	portion	of	the	nation	of	Israel	
       would	welcome	Him	as	king	when	He	came.
    b. Jesus	did	offer himself	as	the	King	of	Israel, as	stated	in	Zechariah	9:9,	“ _Rejoice	greatly,	_
       _O	daughter	of	Zion!	Shout	in	triumph,	O	daughter	of	Jerusalem!	Behold,	your	king	is	_
       _coming	to	you;	He	is	just	and	endowed	with	salvation,	humble,	and	mounted	on	a	_
       _donkey,	even	on	a	colt,	the	foal	of	a	donkey._ ”	Soon	after,	He	was	rejected	and	 **crucified**.
8. Daniel	9:25d	– So	you	are	to	know	and	discern	that	from	the	issuing	of	a	decree	to	restore	
    and	rebuild	Jerusalem	until	Messiah	the	 **Prince** there	will	be	seven	weeks	and	sixty-two	
    weeks,	it	will	be	built	again,	with	plaza	and	moat,	even	in	times	of	distress.
    a. Gabriel	divided	the	prophecy	of	the	70	weeks	of	seven	into	three	 **parts** ,	two	parts	
       before	Messiah	the	Prince	would	be	presented	and	one	part	(one	week	of	seven	years)	
       afterward	(Dan.	9:27).
       1) The	first	division	of	 _seven	_ **_weeks_** (seven	weeks	of	seven)	equals	49	years.
          a) It	took	49	years	for	all	the	debris	to	be	removed	from	Jerusalem	and	for	the	
             moat	and	plaza	to	be fully **completed**.
          b) If	we	start	with	Artaxerxes	decree	to	rebuild	Jerusalem	and	add	49	years,	we	
             have	the	date	when	Jerusalem	was	fully	 **completed** with	moat	(excavations	
             outside	the	walls	for	defense)	and	plaza	(large	courtyard	inside	the	walls	and	
             gates).
          c) As	predicted,	Jerusalem	was	rebuilt	in	times	of	great	 **distress** .	Nehemiah	4
       2) The	second	division	Gabriel	announced	was	sixty-two	weeks	of	seven	years,	which	
          equals	434	years.	(49	years	+	434	years	=	483	years,	or	sixty-nine	weeks)	At	the	
          completion	of	483	years,	you	arrive	at	the	precise	date	of	Christ’s	triumphal	 **entry**
          into	Jerusalem.






a) The	Lord’s	triumphal	entry	into	Jerusalem	on	Palm	Sunday	marked	the	end	of	
the	first	sixty-nine	weeks	of	seven	years	(483	years)	to	the	 exact day.	How	do	we	
know	this?	By	doing	the	math	we	can	identify	the	date	referred	to	here	by	
Gabriel.
b) A	lunar	calendar	has	360	days	in	a	year	and	is	often	referred	to	as	a	 prophetic
year.
c) The	69	weeks	of	seven	years	equals	 483 years.	When	we	multiply	483	years	by	
360	days,	it	equals	173,880	days.
d) We	know	that	on	March	5,	444	BC	Artaxerxes	decreed	that	Jerusalem	was	to	be	
rebuilt.
e) If	we	 add 173,880	days	to	that	date,	we	come	to	March	30,	33	AD.	Was	that	an	
important	day?
(i) Yes,	that	was	the	day	Gabriel	said	 Messiah the	Prince would	be	present.	
(ii) March	30,	33	AD	was	 Palm Sunday.	That	was	the	very	day	Jesus	rode	into	
Jerusalem	and	offered	himself	as	king	to	Israel.
(iii) That	same	day	the	first	69	weeks	(483	years)	of	Israel’s	70	weeks	of	
decreed	discipline	 ended .	Only	one	week	of	seven	years	remained.	Luke	
19:41- 44
b. God	made	this	prophetic	calendar	so	precise	Daniel	and	Israel	could	know	with certainty	
the	 exact time	of	Messiah’s	appearance.	A	literal	understanding	of	this	prophecy	gave	
Simeon	the	knowledge	to	expect	the	arrival	of	Messiah.	Luke	2:25- 35
c. Daniel’s	seventieth	week	remains	to	be	fulfilled	in	the	future.	Its	fulfillment	will	come	in	
the	form	of	 severe tribulation	for	Israel.	It	will	come	about	to	fulfill	the	six	purposes	
stated	in	Daniel	9:24.

9. Daniel	9:26a	– _Then	after	the	sixty-two	weeks..._ With	the	seven	weeks	plus	the	sixty-two	
    weeks	we	have	a	total	of	sixty-nine	weeks	and	then	there	is	a	gap	in	the	prophecy.
    a. The	phrase,	“ _then	after”_ signals	a	change.	Three	significant	events	are	prophesied	to	
       transpire	during	a **gap** between	the	sixty-ninth	week	and	the	seventieth	week.
    b. God	alone	knows	how	long	this	gap	will	last,	but	we	know	the	 **Church** Age	occurs	within	
       this	time	frame.
    c. Let’s	now	look	at	the	three	significant	 **events** that	occur	during	the	gap	between	the	
       sixty-ninth	and	seventh	weeks.
10. Daniel	9:26b	– The	first	significant	event	to	follow	the	sixty-ninth	week	is	the	 **death** of	
    Messiah.	We	saw	that	Christ	was	alive	on	the	day	(Palm	Sunday)	the	first	69	weeks	of	
    discipline	ended.






a. Then	after	the	sixty-two	weeks	the	Messiah	will	be	cut	off... Gabriel	told	Daniel	that	after	
the	sixty-ninth	week,	 Messiah MASHIACH,	the	“ anointed one”,	would	be	 cut	off ,	or	in	
other	words,	killed.	This	event	happened	five	days	after	Christ’s	triumphal	entry	into	
Jerusalem	on	Palm	Sunday.
b. Also,	 Messiah	will	...have	nothing .	When	Christ	died,	He	had	 nothing .	Having	been	
rejected	by	His	own	people,	he	was	now	a	king	with	no	crown,	no	throne,	no	nation,	and	
no	rule.	Isaiah	53:8,	Mark	9:12,	Luke	24:26

11. Daniel	9:26c	– The	second	significant	event	that	would	follow	the	sixty-ninth	week	was	a	
    prophesied	destruction	of	Jerusalem	and	its	temple.	 _Then	after	...the	people	of	the	prince	_
    _who	is	to	come	will	destroy	the	city	and	the	sanctuary._
    a. Inside	this	statement,	we	find	 **two** prophecies,	a	near	and	a	far.
       1) In	the	 **near** future,	 _the	people...will	destroy	the	city	and	the	sanctuary_ .	Gabriel	
          prophesied	that	in	the	near	future,	people	would	destroy	Jerusalem.
       2) The	far	prophecy	is	“couched”	within	the	first.	The	phrase	 _of	the	prince	who	is	to	_
          _come_ lets	us	know	that	in	the	 **far** future	a	prince	will	come	from	these	people.
       3) _The	people_ refers	to	the	fourth,	or	 **Roman** ,	empire. History	teaches	us	this	fact.
    b. History	shows	that	 _the	_ **_people_** who	destroyed	the	city	and	the	sanctuary	were	the	
       Romans.	This	happened	in	70	AD.
    c. The	prophesied	Antichrist is	 _...the	_ **_prince_** _who	is	to	come_ .	This	prophecy	also	makes	it	
       clear	that	the	Antichrist	will	pertain	to	the	Roman,	or	fourth,	Empire.
    d. From	Daniel	seven	we	know	that	the	little	 **horn** will	rise	in	the	latter	stage	of	the	fourth	
       empire,	a strong indication that	 _the	prince	who	is	to	come_ is	the	Antichrist.	Daniel	7:8
12. Daniel	9:26d	– The	third	significant	event	will	be	ongoing. This	ongoing	event	will	be	wars	
    and	determined	(by	God)	desolations	that	will	affect	 **Israel** .	 _And	its	end	will	come	with	a	_
    _flood;	even	to	the	end	there	will	be	war;	desolations	are	determined._
    a. The	interval	between	Christ’s	triumphal	entry	into	Jerusalem	and	Daniel’s	seventieth	
       week	of	seven	years	will	be	filled	with	some	occasional desolations	(Jerusalem	empty	
       and	in	ruin)	but	with ongoing **wars**. Matthew	24:6
    b. Although	it	is	clear	from	scripture	that	the	seventh	week	of	sevens will	be	the	worst	
       time	period	in	earth’s	history,	trumping	all	genocides	Israel	has	ever	faced	up	until	then,	
       the	statement	even	to	the	end	makes	clear	that	wars	and	desolations	would	be	 **ongoing**
       from	the	end	of	the	sixty-ninth	week	until	the	end	of	the	Tribulation.	Matthew	24:21- 22
       1) The	land	of	Israel faced	 **wars** from	70	AD	until	1291,	when	the	Crusades	ended.
       2) Jerusalem	and	Palestine	languished	under	Muslim	rule	from	1291	until	1920,	at	
          which	time	it	came	under	British	 **control** .	Then	in	1947	when	Israel	gained	its	
          independence.






3) Modern wars	and	desolations	for	Israel	and	Jerusalem	include	the	following:
a) 1947 - 1949:	Israel’s	War	of	 Independence.
b) 1956:	Israel	fought	the	 Suez Crisis.
c) 1967:	Israel	fought the Six Day	War.
d) 1967 - 1970:	Israel	fought	the	War	of	 Attrition.
e) 1973:	Israel	fought	the	Yom	 Kippur War.
f) 1973	 – Present:	Israel	is	constantly	involved	in	skirmishes	with	neighboring	
countries,	the	Palestinians, and	various	 terrorist organizations.

13. Daniel	9:27a	– _And	he	_ [Antichrist]	 _will	make	a	firm	covenant	with	the	many	_ [Israel] _for	one	_
    _week	..._ Here	we	can	pinpoint	the	start	of	the	seventh	seven,	the	final	week	of	Daniel.
    a. _And	he_ refers	back	to	 _the	prince	who	is	to	come_ ,	also	known	as	the	little	horn	of	Daniel	
       seven	(Dan.	7:20),	the	Antichrist	(1	John	2:18),	the	man	of	lawlessness	(2	Thess.	2:3),	
       and	the	Beast	(Rev.	13:4).	Before	the	ink	is	dry	on	this	 **covenant** ,	the	Tribulation	will	
       have	begun.
    b. In	some	way,	the	Antichrist	will	have	to	have	gained	political **influence** and	authority	in	
       order	to	sign this	covenant with	Israel.
    c. The	ones	who	receive	the	covenant	are	 _the	many_ ,	speaking	of	the	 **majority** of	Israel.	
       This	covenant	is	supposed	to	last	 _for	one	week_ or	seven	years.	For	there	to	be	a	national	
       covenant	with	Israel,	they	will	have	to	be	living	in	the	land,	as	is	the	case	right	now.
       1) After	having	been	repeatedly	 **lied** to	and	tricked	by	treaties,	it	is	amazing	that	Israel	
          will	trust	this	man.	The	real	question	is	why	would they	not	just	trust	God	to protect	
          them	in fulfillment	of His	promises	in	the	Abrahamic	covenant?
       2) For	some	sad	reason,	Israel	will	trust	this	evil,	 **devious** man	who	they	will	see	as	a	
          type	of	savior.	He,	on	the	other	hand,	will	have	no	intention	of	keeping	his	word.
    d. When	will	this	happen?	This	will	happen	at	the	 **beginning** of	the	Tribulation	period.	God	
       alone	knows	when	that	will	be;	we	only	know	it	is	getting	closer	with	each	passing	day.
    e. This	future	covenant,	made	with	Israel’s	majority,	starts	the	clock	ticking	for	the	 **final**
       week	of	seven	years	of	Israel’s	discipline,	as	declared	by	Gabriel.	The	final	seven years	of	
       Daniel’s	seventy	week is	the	Tribulation,	with	the	evil	Antichrist	on	the	scene.
14. Daniel	9:27b	– Will	the	Antichrist	keep his	covenant?	 _...	but	in	the	middle	of	the	week	he	will	_
    _put	a	_ **_stop_** _to	sacrifice	and	grain	offering..._
    a. The	middle	of	the	week	is	3½	years	 **after** the	signing	of	the	treaty ( _firm	covenant_ ).
    b. Before	this	event	can	take	place,	there	will	of	necessity	need	to	be	a	temple	and	temple	
       worship;	therefore,	the	temple	will	have	to	have	been	reconstructed	sometime	 **before**
       the	mid-point	of	the	Tribulation.	Revelation	11:1- 2






c. To	God	this	temple	worship	will	have	no	value,	not	having been	sanctioned	by	Him.	
Israel	will	be	in	a	state	of	unbelief	and	will	simply	be	going	through	the	motions	of	
religion .	These	sacrifices	will	be	pure	religious	pageantry.
d. At	the	time	mentioned	in	this	verse,	3½	years	after	the	signing	of	the	covenant,	the	
Antichrist	will	 break the	covenant	and	introduce	something	into	the	temple	that	will	
stop	all	religious	activities.	Persecution	against	the	Jews	will	immediately	breakout.	
Daniel	7:25,	12:7;	Matthew	24:15-28;	Revelation	13:11- 18

15. Daniel	9:27c	– _...and	on	the	wing	of	abominations	will	come	one	who	makes	desolate... The	_
    _wing	of	abominations_ refers	to	a	statue	of	the	Antichrist	housed	in	the	temple.	This	 **image**
    will	cause	Israel	to	abandon	the	temple.
    a. The	word	abomination	in	the	Old	Testament	was	often	associated	with	 **idol** worship.	
       Deuteronomy 7:26,	27:15;	1	Kings	11:5-7;	Isaiah	44:19
    b. We	understand	that	the	Antichrist	will	set	up	an	image	of	himself	in	the	temple	in	
       Jerusalem. This	image	will be	 **animated** supernaturally.	Daniel	12:11,	Matthew	24:15-
       21,	2	Thessalonians	2:3-4,	Revelation	13:14- 15
    c. Satan’s	anger	will	motivate	the	Antichrist	to	escalate	his	 **persecution** of	the	Jews.	Those	
       who	understand	this	prophecy	at	that	time	should	flee	the	city	quickly.	Matthew	24:16-
       21,	Revelation	12:13- 17
    d. Millions	of	people	from	all	nations	will	die	during	the	Tribulation.	Nevertheless,	Israel	
       will	survive,	although	it	will	be	greatly	 **reduced** in	number.	Only	believers	in	Jesus	as	
       Messiah	will	be	permitted	to	enter	the	Millennial	Kingdom. Church	Age	saints	will	
       already	have	been	raptured	before	the	seven-year Tribulation	begins.
16. Daniel	9:27d	– _...even	until	a	complete	destruction,	one	that	is	decreed,	is	poured	out	on	the	_
    _one	who	makes	desolate._ The	one	who	made	the	temple	 **desolate** is	the	Antichrist.	This	
    verse	verifies	that	he	will	be	terminated.
    a. Thankfully,	the	Antichrist’s	rule	and	worship	will	be	short-lived	due	to	his	 _complete	_
       _destruction_ .	He	will	rule	for	seven	years. After	his final	three-and-a-half-year	reign	of	
       **terror** ,	the	clock	will	stop,	ending	the	final	week	of	Daniel’s	seventy	weeks.
    b. This	means	that	the	Antichrist’s	reign	of	terror	will	 **end** simultaneously	with	the	end	of	
       the	prophesied	seventieth	week.	The	seventieth	week	ends...
       1) Because	the	Antichrist	is	 **killed**.
       2) Because	God	keeps	His	word	and	the	 **decreed** weeks	of	judgment	will	have	ended.
       3) Because	 _unless	those	days	had	been	cut	_ **_short_** _,	no	life	would	have	been	saved;	but	_
          _for the	sake	of	the elect	those	days	will	be	cut	short_ .	Matthew	24:22
    c. Below	is	a	list	of	 **verses** that	show	the	Antichrist’s	rise	to	power	and	quick	demise.
       1) 1	John	2:18	– John	predicted	the	 **coming** of	the	Antichrist.
       2) Matthew	24:15- 28	 – Jesus	spoke	of	the	 **Abomination** of	Desolations	standing	in	the	
          Holy	Place.	This	is	a	representation	of	the	Antichrist.	Revelation	13:14- 18






3) Daniel	9:27	– Gabriel	predicted	that	 he,	the	prince	who	is	to	come ,	would	 break the	
covenant made	with	Israel’s	majority	at	the	midpoint	of	the	seven-year	covenant.
4) Daniel	7:25	– The	little	 horn was	predicted	to	come	and	wear	down	the	saints	of	the	
Highest	One,	for	a	time,	times	and	half	time	(3½	years).
5) Revelation	13:4- 7	 – We	see	that	the	beast	will	be	given	 authority to	act	for	forty-
two	months	(3½	years).
6) 2	Thessalonians	2:3- 10	 – These	verses	speak	of	the	man	of	 lawlessness who	will	set
himself	up	as	God	in	the	temple	and	whom	 the	Lord	will	slay with	the	breath	of	His	
mouth.

**H. Closing	observations	from	Daniel	nine**

1. God	has	a	future	for	Israel	 **unrelated** to	the	church.
2. God	wants	us	to	 **understand** these	plans	even	though	we	won't	be	on	earth	during	the	
    Tribulation	to	see	their	completion.
3. Israel	rejected	its	Messiah	and	King,	Jesus	Christ.	God	designed	the	final	seven	years	of	
    Israel’s	discipline	to	get	Israel	ready	for	 **believing** in	King	Jesus.	Matthew	23:37- 39
4. The	Tribulation	with	its	fierce	anti-Semitism	is	designed	to	 **transform** all	Israel.	Romans	
    11:26
5. Finally,	as	a	 **nation** ,	Israel	will	come	to	believe	in	Jesus	Christ	the	Messiah.	The	six	purposes	
    in	Daniel	9:24	will	be	accomplished.	Jeremiah	33:1 4 - 18,	Romans	11:26
6. All	scripture	 **agrees** concerning	the	coming	end	times	and	the	arrival	of	the	Antichrist.
7. In	the	end,	God	will	win	the	longstanding	angelic	 **war** ,	answering	the	great	question	of	all	
    time,	“Who	has	the	right to	rule?”	Ephesians	6:12
8. In	verse 26	we	see	that	Messiah	was	to	be	 **cut** off.	The	question	is	who	killed Jesus?
    a. Was	it	unbelieving	 **Israel**?
    b. Was	it	calloused	and	indifferent	religious	 **leaders**?
    c. Was	it	cruel-hearted	 **Roman** rulers?
    d. Was	it	cold-blooded	 **soldiers**?
    e. No,	it	was	our	sin;	 **we** are	the	reason	Christ	had	to	go	to	the	cross.	Thank	God	for	the	
       death	of	Jesus	Christ	and	his	subsequent	resurrection.	Isaiah	53:5;	1	Corinthians	15:3;	1	
       Peter	1:20,	3:18
    f. Have	you	personally	trusted	in	Christ,	who	laid down	his	life	for	your	sins	and	rose	
       again?	He	is a	living	Savior	and	He	desires	to	rescue	you	from	the	terrible	fate	of	eternal	
       separation	from	Him.	Would	you	 **believe** in	him	today?
9. What	should	be	our	 **response** to	these	prophecies?	1	Thessalonians	5:4- 11	





**XIII. A	Prelude	to	the	Last	Three	Chapters	of	Daniel.**

**A. Introduction**

1. The	book	of	Daniel	gives	us	an	understanding	of	human	history	from	God's	 **perspective** ,	
    especially	as	it	relates	to	Israel.
2. Only	as	we	study	God's	accounts	of	history	as	chronicled	in	His	Word	(especially	the	
    historical	books),	can	we	begin	to	properly	 **interpret** world	history.
3. Through	this	final	vision	with	its	interpretation	(Dan.	10-12),	we	understand	that	at	the	time	
    of	Daniel	the	complete	fulfillment	of	Israel’s	restoration	and	ultimate	peace	was	still	many	
    years	 **future**.
4. In	fulfillment	of	prophecy,	the	people	of	Israel	would	face	many	 **difficult** days	of	suffering.	
    Theoretically,	they	could	have	avoided	so	much	pain	and	suffering	had	they	simply	trusted	
    God	and	believed	in	Christ	as	Messiah.	Even	now,	this	is	true	for	all	people	everywhere.
5. Despite	Israel’s	failures,	and	in	God’s	perfect	timetable,	He	will	 **establish** Israel	permanently	
    in	the	Promised	Land	just	as	He	promised	in His	covenants	to	Israel.	Genesis	12:1-3,	15:7;	
    Deuteronomy	29- 30
6. As	we	have	discovered,	some	of	Daniel’s	prophecies	concerning	Israel	were	near	fulfillments	
    while	others	still	 **remained** to	be	fulfilled	in	the	distant	future.
7. During	this	time	of	waiting	for distant	future	prophecies	to	be	fulfilled,	Israel	needed	to	
    remain	persuaded	of	God’s	 **faithfulness** and	protection	of	them	in	the	short-term.

**B. The	escalation	of	Special	Revelation	in	Daniel**

1. Daniel	2	– A	dream	was	given	to	a	Gentile	king	and	its	interpretation	was	given	to	Daniel	
    after	an	 **overnight** prayer	vigil.
2. Daniel	4	– A	dream	was	given	to	a	Gentile	king	with	a	divine	interpretation	given	through	
    Daniel	 **immediately**.
3. Daniel	5	– A	Gentile	king	received	a	supernatural	handwritten	message	on	a	wall	and	Daniel	
    was	immediately	given	its	divine	 **interpretation**.
4. Daniel	7	– Daniel	received	a	stationary	nighttime	vision	requiring	angelic	interpretation	
    resulting	in	 **paleness** to	Daniel’s	countenance.
5. Daniel	8	– Daniel	was	supernaturally	transported	in	a	daytime	vision	in	which	he	saw	the	
    pre-incarnate	 **Christ** (a	Christophany).	He	received	an	angelic	interpretation	of	the	vision.	
    The	interpretation	caused	Daniel	to	sink	 _into	a	deep	sleep	with_ [his]	 _face	to the	ground_ .	
    Daniel	8:18
6. Daniel	9	– In	response	to	his	reading	of	Jeremiah’s	prophecy	and	after	prolonged	prayer	and	
    confession	of	sin,	Gabriel	appeared	to	Daniel	in	a	 **vision** to	give	him	new	information.





7. Daniel	10- 12	 – After	days	of	waiting	in	anguish,	in	response	to	his	prayer,	Daniel	received	a	
    daytime	vision	from	an	unnamed	angel.	Due	to	demonic	interference,	the	prophecy	was	
    **delayed** 21	days.	The	vision	included	a	glimpse	of	the	glorious	pre-incarnate	Lord	Jesus.	
    Throughout	the	vision, Daniel	had	to	be	repeatedly	restored to	health.
    **C. Three	significant	visions	prior	to	the	one	in	chapter	ten**
1. In	chapter	seven,	during	the	first	year	of	Babylonian	King	Belshazzar’s	rule	(Dan.	7:1),	Daniel	
saw	a	vision	that	compared	the	 **beastly** empires	of	human	rule	with	the	perfect	rule	of	the	
ultimate	human,	Jesus	Christ,	who	will	rule	over	the	fifth	and	final	empire	during	the	
Millennial	Kingdom.
2. In	chapter	eight,	during	the	third	year	of	Babylonian	King	Belshazzar’s	rule	(Dan.	8:1),	Daniel	
saw	a	vision	that	described	important	 **rulers** from	the	third	and	fourth	world	empires.	This	
alerted Israel	of	hard	days	to	come.
3. In	chapter	nine,	during	the	first	year	of	King	Darius’	rule	(under	Persian	King	Cyrus,	Dan	9:1-
2),	Daniel	saw	another	vision	that	gave	the	timetable	for	Israel’s	complete	 **restoration** to	
the	Promised	Land.	Only	after	sinful	man’s	empires	have	all	risen	and	fallen,	will	God	finally	
establish	His	perfect	kingdom	on	earth.
4. In	chapters	10-12,	during	the	third	year	of	Persian	King	Cyrus’	rule	(Dan.	10:1),	Daniel	saw	
yet	one	more	vision.	Although	this	vision	adversely	affected	Daniel,	it	provided	valuable	
**information** about	Israel’s	future.

**XIV. Daniel	10:1- 9	 – An	Appearance	of	Christ**

**A. Daniel	10:1- 3	 – Daniel’s	desperation**

1. Daniel	10:1a	– _In	the	third	year	of	Cyrus	king	of	Persia	_ [536	BC] _a	message	was	revealed	to	_
    _Daniel,	who	was	named	Belteshazzar...._ Lest	there	be	any	doubt,	this	confirms	that	Daniel	is	
    Belteshazzar,	the	same	person	we	have	followed	throughout	this	book.	Much	destructive	
    confusion	has	been	caused	by	 **skeptics** who	deny	Daniel’s	authorship	of	these	chapters.
2. Daniel	10:1b	– _...and	the	message	was	true	and	one	of	great	conflict,	...._ Daniel	had	received	
    a	message	(not	divine)	that	seemed	to	 **disagree** with	the	vision	he	had	gotten	from	the	Lord	
    in	Daniel	nine	about	Israel’s	return	to	the	land	and	the	restoration	of	the	nation	and	temple.
    a. Daniel’s	grieving	occurred	two	years	 **after** Persian	King	Cyrus	had	decreed	that	all	Jews	
       should	return	to	the	land	and	rebuild	the	temple.	Sadly,	only	a	remnant	of	Judah	
       returned	and	through	much	difficulty	began	working	on	the	temple.	Ezra	1:1,	3:8
    b. The	Samaritans	in	the	area	wanted	to	help	rebuild the	temple,	but	Zerubbabel,	the	
       Jewish	governor	of	Judea,	wisely	 **rejected** their	offer.	In	anger,	the	Samaritans	appealed	
       to	the	Persian	state	authorities	and	all	work	on	the	temple	rebuilding	project	stopped.	
       Ezra	4:1- 24	





3. Daniel	10:1c	– _...but	he	understood	the	message	and	had	an	understanding	of	the	vision._ The	
    message	and	the	vision	were	two	conflicting	realities	that	caused	turmoil	in	Daniel’s	 **soul**.
    a. Presumably	the	message	was	the	 **news** that	the	temple	reconstruction	had	stopped.
    b. The	verifiable	nature	of	the	message	caused	Daniel	to	 **mourn** and	embark	on	a	three-
       week	fast	to	seek	the	Lord	in	prayer.	Ezra	4:21,	Daniel	10:12
    c. Daniel	believed	the	message	was	 **true** ,	but	it	seemed	to	be	in conflict	with	the	vision	
       Gabriel	had	given	him	merely	two	years	earlier.
4. Daniel	10:2	– _In	those	days,	I,	Daniel,	had	been	mourning	for	three	entire	weeks._ Daniel’s	
    state	of	extreme	 **sadness** had	lasted	three	full	weeks.
    a. There	was	a	spiritual	 **battle** going	on	behind	the	scenes	that	kept	Daniel	from	receiving	a	
       quick	explanation	from	the	Lord	concerning	this bad	news	in	the	message.
    b. Although	this	verse	focuses	primarily	on	Daniel’s	deep	state	of	 **mourning** ,	we	learn	later	
       that	Daniel	did	indeed	pray	and	seek	the	Lord’s	help	to	understand	this	contradiction.	
       Daniel	11:12
    c. With	no	answer, Daniel	became	heart-sick.	Unknown	to	Daniel,	there	was	a	fierce	
       stuggle going	on	in	the	celestial	realms	that	mirrored	the	conflict	in	the	earthly	realms.	
       That	conflict	kept	him	from	receiving	God’s	 **response** three	weeks	earlier.	Daniel	11:13
5. Daniel	10:3	– _I	did	not	eat	any	tasty	food,	nor	did	meat	or	wine	enter	my	mouth,	nor	did	I	_
    _use	any	ointment	at	all	until	the	entire	three	weeks	were	completed._ Daniel	was	a	Persian	
    administrator	and	may	have	been	out	on	official	business.	He	was	over	on	the	Tigris	River,	a	
    long	way	from	home,	when	he	began	this “working-man’s-fast”	of	simple	food	and	water.	
    a. In	his	state	of	mourning,	Daniel	refused	to	enjoy	the	physical	pleasures	of	life.	He	was	
       preoccupied,	trying	to	make	sense	of the	troubling	message	in	light	of	God’s	previous	
       vision.	Even	though	the	seventy-year	captivity	had	officially	ended,	Israel’s	 **enemies**
       were	still	successfully hindering the	temple reconstruction.
    b. By	means	of	the	new	vision	of	chapters	10-12,	Daniel	was	about	to	hear	that	Israel’s	
       woes	were	only	 **beginning** .	He	would	be	told	about	an	upcoming	conflict	between	the	
       northern	Greek	kings	of	Syria	and	the	southern	Greek	kings	of	Egypt	that	would	repress	
       Israel	from	above	and	below.	This	would	turn	Israel	into	a	long-term	battlefield.
    c. He	would	also	learn	addition	information	about	the	coming	 **genocides** to	be	committed	
       against	his	people	by	the	two	little	horns.	One	little	horn	was	to	be	of	Greek	extraction	
       and	the	other	of	Roman	origin.	Both	little	horns	would	appear	in	the	latter	years	of	their	
       respective	empires.

**B. Daniel	10:4- 9	 – A	Christophany**

1. Daniel	10:4	– _On	the	twenty-fourth	day	of	the	first	month,	while	I	was	by	the	bank	of	the	_
    _great	river,	that	is,	the	Tigris_ ... Daniel	was	now	a	very	 **old** prophet	(85-90	years	old).	For	
    some	unknown	reason,	he	was	away	from	Babylon	at	this	time.	We	also	do	not	know	why	
    he	was	standing	on	the	banks	of	the	Tigris	River.





2. Daniel	10:5	– _I	lifted	my	eyes	and	looked,	and	behold,	there	was	a	certain	man	dressed	in	_
    _linen,	whose	waist	was	girded	with	a	belt	of	pure	gold	of	Uphaz._ This	remarkable	man	that	
    Daniel	saw	was	 **God** manifested	in	human	form.
    a. God	likely	appeared	as	a	man	in	order	to	be	 **perceptible** to	Daniel.	But	this	was	not	your	
       average	man;	He	was	magnificent	in	appearance	and	dressed	in	majestic	apparel.	
       Genesis	12:7-9,	32:22-30,	2	Kings	19:35,	John	1:16- 18
    b. Some	teachers	claim	this	person	was	Gabriel,	but	Daniel	had	seen	Gabriel	on	previous	
       occasions	without	the adverse	reaction he	will	now	have	in	these	verses.	Daniel’s	
       reaction	to	this	vision	was	unwarranted	for	simply	seeing	an	angel.	He	was	in	the	
       **presence** of	God,	as	the	text	will	bear	out.
3. Daniel	10:6a	– _His	body	also	was	like	beryl,	his	face	had	the	appearance	of	lightning,	his	eyes	_
    _were	like	flaming	torches,	his	arms	and	feet	like	the	gleam	of	polished	bronze...	_ Daniel’s	
    description	 **matches** closely	the	Apostle	John’s	description	of	our	majestic	Lord	found	in	
    Revelation	1:12-15.
    a. **Ezekiel** saw	a	similar	vision	in	Ezekiel	1:26-28.
    b. In	all	three	instances,	the	men	who	viewed	the	Lord	had	the	very	same	 **reaction** ;	all	
       three	collapsed	unconscious	and	had	to	be	resuscitated.
    c. This	gives	meaning	to	why someday, _at	the	name	of	Jesus	EVERY	KNEE	WILL	_ **_BOW_** _,	of	_
       _those	who	are	in	heaven	and	on	earth	and	under	the	earth_ .	Philippians	2:10
4. Daniel	10:6b	– _...	and	the	sound	of	his	words	like	the	sound	of	a	_ **_tumult_** .	In	Revelation	1:15	
    the	Apostle	John	also	described	the	voluminous	and	powerful	sound	of	God’s	voice.
    a. This	vision	might	not	seem	impressive	to	you,	but	upon	experiencing	Christ’s	glorious	
       presence	in	this	way	both	John	and	Daniel	 **collapsed** unconscious.	Daniel	10:8-9,	
       Revelation	1:17
    b. God’s	majesty	can	hardly	be	 **expressed** in	human	words.	2	Corinthians	12:4
5. Daniel	10:7	– _Now	I,	Daniel,	alone	saw	the	vision,	while	the	men	who	were	with	me	did	not	_
    _see	the	vision;	nevertheless,	a	great	dread	fell	on	them,	and	they	ran	away	to	hide	_
    _themselves_ .	Although	Daniel	was	the	only	one	who	saw	the	vision,	the	others	with	him,	
    filled	with	dread,	 **ran** for	their	lives	and	hid.	Acts	9:3- 7
6. Daniel	10:8	– _So	I	was	left	alone	and	saw	this	great	vision;	yet	no	strength	was	left	in	me,	for	_
    _my	natural	color	turned	to	a	deathly	pallor,	and	I	retained	no	strength._ Alone	in	the	
    presence	of our	awesome	God,	Daniel	was	immediately	drained	of	all	 **vigor** .	Revelation	1:17
7. Daniel	10:9	– _But	I	heard	the	sound	of	his	words;	and	as	soon	as	I	heard	the	sound	of	his	_
    _words,	I	fell	into	a	deep	sleep	on	my	face,	with	my	face	to	the	ground_ .	God's	speech	sounded	
    like	a	mighty	 _tumult_ ,	and	the	turbulence	of	his	voice	drove	Daniel	instantly	into	a	profound	
    sleep.	As	when	one	faints,	Daniel	was	suddenly	face	down	on	the	 **ground** .	Daniel	10:6b





**XV. Daniel	10:10-11:1	– The	Repercussions	to	the	Vision**

**A. Daniel	10:10- 14	 – Daniel	was	revived	and	informed**

1. Daniel	10:10	– _Then	behold,	a	hand	touched	me	and	set	me	trembling	on	my	hands	and	_
    _knees._ An	angel	roused	Daniel	from	his	comatose	state.	Although	he	boosted	Daniel	to	his	
    hands	and	 **knees** ,	Daniel	was	still	shuddering.
    a. Before	Daniel	had	passed	out,	God had allowed	him	to	catch	a	glimpse	of	His	
       resplendent	glory	and	hear	His	thunderous	voice.	Before	Daniel received	any	orders,	
       God	wisely	revealed	to	him	His	glory.	This	knowledge	would	assure Daniel	he	could	
       unreservedly	 **trust** God’s	plans,	even	when	he	did	not	understand. Exodus	33:17- 23
    b. The	angel	who	helped	Daniel to	his	hands	and	knees	would	soon	give	him a	deeper	
       understanding	of	the	perils	ahead	for	Israel.	This	 **angel** who	helped	him	up	was	the	one	
       who	would	primarily	address	Daniel	from	this	point	forward.
2. Daniel	10:11a	– _He	said	to	me,	“O	Daniel,	man	of	high	esteem_ ...	The	angel	addressed	Daniel	
    as	 _man	of	high	esteem_ .	This	title	reflected	God’s	 **pleasure** in	Daniel’s	life	of	faith.	Hebrews	
    11:1-2,	6,	33
3. Daniel	10:11b	– The	angel	had	been	sent	by	God.	 _...understand	the	words	that	I	am	about	to	_
    _tell	you	and	stand	upright,	for	I	have	now	been	sent	to	you.”	And	when	he	had	spoken	this	_
    _word	to	me,	I	stood	up	trembling._ In	order	to	understand	the	message,	Daniel	would	need	
    to	be	standing,	 **attentive** ,	and	clear-headed.
4. Daniel	10:12	– _Then	he	said	to	me,	“Do	not	be	afraid,	Daniel,	for	from	the	first	day	that	you	_
    _set	your	heart	on	understanding	this	and	on	humbling	yourself	before	your	God,	your	words	_
    _were	heard,	and	I	have	come	in	response	to	your	words._ Although	Daniel’s	expression	of	
    faith	through	prayer	was	heard	the	first	day	Daniel	prayed,	the	 **answer** a	long	time	to	arrive.
5. Daniel	10:13a	– _But	the	prince	of	the	kingdom	of	Persia	was	withstanding	me	for	twenty-one	_
    _days..._ This	prince	of	the	kingdom	of	Persia	was	no	mere	human	being;	for	21	days, he	had	
    successfully	blocked	one	of	God’s	angels.	This	was	a	 **fallen** angel,	a	ruler	from	Satan’s	
    dominion	of	darkness.	Ephesians	6:12
6. Daniel	10:13b	– _...then	behold,	Michael,	one	of	the	chief	princes,	came	to	help	me,	for	I	had	_
    _been	left	there	with	the	kings	of	Persia._ Although	God	answered	Daniel’s	prayer	by	
    dispatching	an	angel,	the	angel	was	delayed	by	a	particularly	strong	fallen	angel	called	the	
    Prince	of	Persia.	The	angel	Michael	had	to	come	to	his	 **aid**.
    a. In	Daniel	nine,	Gabriel	had	seemingly	not	been	hindered	from	reaching	Daniel,	but	here	
       a	 **demon** of	high	authority	hindered	God’s	angelic	messenger.
    b. The	prince	of	Persia	was	apparently	a	powerful	demon	who	influenced	the	Persian	
       Empire.	As	part	of	Satan’s	dark	order,	he	had	somehow	been	allowed	to	 **prevent** this	
       interpreting	angel	from	delivering	the	important	prophecy	to	Daniel.	This	kind	of	
       demonic	intrusion	is	seen	elsewhere	in	Scripture.






1) In	Second	Corinthians	Paul	warned	believers	not	to	be	ignorant	of	Satan’s	 devices (2	
Cor.	2,	11)	and	gave	some	examples:	Satan	blinds	the	minds	of	the	unbelieving	(2	
Cor.	4:3-4),	deceives	Christians	(2	Cor.	11:3),	and	even	masquerades	as	an	angel	of	
light	(2	Cor.	11:14).
2) At	the	time	of	Daniel’s	writing,	Satan	was	likely	focused on	preventing	 Messiah
from	coming.	Persia’s	pro-Israel	policy	likely	frustrated	many of	Satan’s	plans.
c. An	angel	by	the	name	of	Michael	assisted	the interpreting	angel	against	the	demon	over	
Persia,	thereby	allowing	him	to	finally	 deliver the	message	to	Daniel.
1) This	is	the	first	mention	of	Michael	in Scripture.	Michael	is	one	of	God’s	 chief
angels.	In	the	New	Testament,	he	is	called	an	archangel	(arch	means	first	or	chief).	
Jude	1:9
2) He	is	called	the	 defender of	Daniel’s	people,	Israel.	Daniel	12:1
3) Satan	and	Michael	had	sparred	in	the	past	(Jude	1:9).	They	once	fought	over	the	
body	of	 Moses ,	which	God	did	not	want	discovered,	and	so	God	hid	his	tomb to	this	
day.	Deuteronomy	34:6,	Jude	1:9
4) Michael	and	Satan	will	again	square	off	in	the	Tribulation,	at	which	time	Michael	
will	be	 victorious .	Revelation	12: 7 - 8
d. This	seem	hard	to	understand.	Why	would	God	allow	this	to	happen?
1) We	need	to	understand	that	just	as	we	struggle	in	our	service	to	God,	the	angels	
also	struggle	to	fulfill	God’s	bidding.	This	gives	us	an	authentic	peek	into	the	unseen	
celestial	 realm where	real	battles	rage	for	the	souls	of	man.
2) God	would	teach	Daniel	that	the	opposition	he	witnessed	against	Israel	had	an	
invisible	spiritual	 equivalent .	Just	as	God’s	plans	were	frustrated	in	Jerusalem	they	
are	sometimes	frustrated	in	the	spiritual	realm.

7. Daniel	10:14	– _Now	I	have	come	to	give	you	an	understanding	of	what	will	happen	to	your	_
    _people	in	the	latter	days,	for	the	vision	pertains	to	the	days	yet	future._ The	angel	came	to	
    give	Daniel	the	information	he	needed	to	understand	why	Israel	would	 **continue** to	suffer	
    and	to	give	Daniel	the	confidence	to	patiently	wait	on	the	Lord’s	timing	to	deliver	Israel.
    a. This	experience	would	serve	to	be	an	unforgettable	object	lesson	for	all	future	readers	
       to	not	quickly	lose	heart	when	prayers	go	unanswered.	God is	still	in	control	and	will	
       have	the	ultimate	 **victory**.
    b. Daniel	needed	to	understand	that	if	God’s	plans	could	be	frustrated	in	the	angelic	
       realms,	he	should	not	be	surprised	to	learn	that	God’s	plans	in	the	physical	realm	can	
       equally	be	frustrated.	But	not	to	worry,	the	temple	would	be	rebuilt	and	Jerusalem	
       would	again	be	inhabited.	It	was	a	matter	of	 **time**.





**B. Daniel	10:15-11:1	– Daniel’s	fortification**

1. Daniel	10:15	– _When	he	had	spoken	to	me	according	to	these	words,	I	turned	my	face	_
    _toward	the	ground	and	became	_ **_speechless_** .	Hearing	the	details	of	the	angelic	conflict	and	of	
    the	delay	Daniel	was	moved	deeply.
    a. He	had	already	been	mourning	for	weeks.
    b. Now	he	was	given	another	heavy	load	to	bear.	This	visiting angel	told	him	of	obstacles	in	
       the	heavenly	realms; spiritual	wickedness	in	high places.
2. Daniel	10:16	– _And	behold,	one	who	resembled	a	human	being	was	touching	my	lips;	then	I	_
    _opened	my	mouth	and	spoke	and	said	to	him	who	was	standing	before	me,	“O	my	lord,	as	a	_
    _result	of	the	vision	anguish	has	come	upon	me,	and	I	have	retained	no	strength._ The	angel	
    came	to	Daniel	to	infuse	 **strength** into	his	unresponsive	lips.	Now,	Daniel	could	speak	again.
    a. The	prophet	Daniel	was	having	great	physical	difficulty.	The	vision	he	had	just	seen	of	
       our	glorious	Lord	had	totally	 **drained** him.
    b. Daniel	addressed	the	angel	with	the	label	 **lord** .	The	word	lord	is	ADONI,	the	equivalent	
       of	saying,	“Sir.”
    c. This	account	shows	our	need	of	a	resurrection	body	in	order	to	physically	survive	God's	
       prese **n** ce.	Luke	1:11-12,	2:9;	1	Corinthians	15:53- 57
3. Daniel	10:17	– _“For	how	can	such	a	servant	of	my	lord	talk	with	such	as	my	lord?	As	for	me,	_
    _there	remains	just	now	no	strength	in	me,	nor	has	any	breath	been	left	in	me.”_ Daniel	was	
    both	traumatized	and	greatly	 **humbled** by	what	he	saw.
4. Daniel	10:18	– _Then	this	one	with	human	appearance	touched	me	again	and	strengthened	_
    _me._ The	angel	had	to	strengthen	Daniel	again.	Daniel	needed	 **stamina** and	alertness	to	
    grasp	and	retain	the	upcoming	barrage	of	complicated	information	found	in	chapter	eleven.
5. Daniel	10:19	– _He	said,	“O	man	of	high	esteem,	do	not	be	afraid.	Peace	be	with	you;	take	_
    _courage	and	be	courageous!”	Now	as	soon	as	he	spoke	to	me,	I	received	strength	and	said,	_
    _“May	my	lord	speak,	for	you	have	strengthened	me.”_ In	this	passage,	Daniel	had	to	be	
    touched	and	strengthened	 **three** times.	Daniel	11:10,	16,	18
    a. The	angel	complimented	Daniel,	but	he	also	had	to	remind	him	four	times	in	four	ways	
       to	be	 **brave** .	“... _do	not	be	afraid,	(1)	peace	be	with	you	(2),	take	courage	(3),	and	be	_
       _courageous	(4).”_
    b. With	this,	Daniel	suddenly	had	strength	to	 **hear** the	angel’s	message.
6. Daniel	10:20a	– _Then	he	said,	“Do	you	understand	why	I	came	to	you?	_ Almost	as	if	he	were	
    checking	to	see	if	Daniel	was	all	there,	he	asked	Daniel	if	he	knew	why	he	had	come	to	him.	
    Earlier	the	angel	had	already	given	him	two	 **reasons** for	coming.
    a. Daniel	10:12	– ... _and	I	have	come	in	_ **_response_** _to	your	words..._
    b. Daniel	10:14	– ... _I	have	come	to	give	you	an	_ **_understanding_** _of	what	will	happen	to	your	_
       _people	in	the	latter	days..._





7. Daniel	10:20b	– _...But	I	shall	now	return	to	fight	against	the	prince	of	Persia;	so	I	am	going	_
    _forth,	and	behold,	the	prince	of	Greece	is	about	to	come._ The	angel	indicated	that	after	
    delivering	his	message,	he	would	immediately	return	to	and	continue	the	spiritual	 **battle**
    already	raging	in	the	heavenly	realms	with	the	 _prince	of	Persia_.
    a. The	angel	said	in	essence,	“I	have	to	go	and	fight	the	demon-prince	of	Persia	and	then	
       right	after	that	I’ll	face	the	demon-prince	of	Greece.”	He	will	tell	us	in	verse	21	that	
       Michael,	the	angel	who	fights	for	Israel,	is	the	only	one	who	 **helped** him	in	this	battle.
    b. This	prince	of	Persia	is	a	high-ranking	evil	demon	who	has	his	realm	in	the Middle	East.	
       Satan’s	forces	are	organized	in	 **ranks** like	an	army.	Colossians	2:15
    c. The	angel	gave	additional	information	about	a	demon	called	 _the	prince	of	Greece_ who	
       would	soon	come	on	the	scene.	This	seemed	to	be	a	concern	for	the	angel	because	he	
       introduced	this	statement	with	“ **_behold_** .”
    d. The	emphasis	on	 **Greece** found	here	in	this	verse	provides	a	heads-up	about	the	
       prophecies	coming	up	in	chapter	eleven	concerning	Greece.
8. Daniel	10: 21 b – _However,	I	will	tell	you	what	is	inscribed	in	the	writing	of	truth._ We	do	not	
    know	of	anything	called	“ _the	writing	of	truth_ .” The	phrase	 _writing	of	truth_ is	 **unusual.**
    a. This	is	likely	a	reminder	to	Daniel	of	what	he	had	previously	recorded	and	been	told	to	
       **seal** up.	Daniel	8:26 (also	Daniel	12:4)
    b. The	angel	is	likely	saying	that	despite	the	message	(letter)	Daniel	received,	Daniel’s	
       vision	about	Israel	being	re-colonized	is	true	and	he	would **confirm** that fact.	Daniel	11
9. Daniel	10: 21 b – _...Yet	there	is	no	one	who	stands	firmly	with	me	against	these	forces	except	_
    _Michael	your	prince._ The	angel told	Daniel	that	no	other	angel	except	Michael	the	prince	
    stood	with	him	in	 **conflict** against	the	prince	of	Persia	and	the	prince	of	Greece.
10. Daniel	11:1	– _In	the	first	year	of	Darius	the	Mede,	I	arose	to	be	an	encouragement	and	a	_
    _protection	for	him._ This	verse	shows	us	that	the	interpreting	angel	had	already	begun	
    helping	 **Michael** since the	first	year	of	King	Darius’	reign.
    a. During	the	early	years	of	Darius’	reign,	the	Persian	Empire	 **wavered** between	being	pro-
       Israel	or	anti-Israel.	Daniel	6
    b. In	an	amazing	turn	of	events,	the	Persian	Empire	had	become	pro-Israel.	Daniel’s	near	
       **death** experience	in	the	den	of	hungry	lions	had	turned	the	tables	on	those	who	were	
       against	Israel.	At	that	time,	many	(if	not	all)	anti-Israel	leaders	were	eliminated	from	
       high	government.	Daniel	6:24
    c. Even	while	Daniel	faced	the	lions,	a	spiritual	conflict	raged	behind	the	scenes	in	the	
       heavenly	realms.	Satan	never	tires	of	manipulating	people	to	oppose,	pervert	and	
       **prevent** God's	plans.	Ephesians	6:12





**C. Observations	from	Daniel	10**

1. Any	believer,	whose	faith	motivates	his	actions	like	Daniel’s	did,	is	 **honored** by	God.	
    Galatians	5:6,	1	Thessalonians	1:8,	Hebrews	11:6,	1	Peter	1:6- 7
2. In	the	Bible,	any	time	someone	stood	in	the	presence	of	God,	he	was	 **overwhelmed** ,	aware	
    of	his	unrighteousness,	stripped	of	all	boasting,	and	understood	that	God	is	God	and	that	he	
    is	nothing.	Isaiah	6:5
3. We	see	only	the	physical	realm,	but	there	is	far	more	going	on	around	us	than	meets	the	
    eye.	There	are	things	that	happen in	human	history	that	parallel	unseen	 **celestial** struggles	
    between	God’s	good	angels	and	Satan’s	subordinates.	1	Kings	22:13-28,	2	Chronicles	18:18-
    22,	Revelation	12:3- 4
4. This	unseen	conflict	started	long,	long	ago.	Satan	was	the	first	angel	to	fall	and	did so	
    because	of	pride	(Is.	14:12-15).	When	he	and	his	angelic	followers	were	thrown	down,	they	
    set	up	a	kingdom	of	 **darkness**.
5. Key	to	this	conflict	is	 **humanity** .	Who	has	the	right	to	rule	and	to	receive	worship?	Will	
    humankind	worship	and	follow	God	or	Satan?	Will	humanity	believe	God’s	truth	or	Satan’s	
    lies?
6. All	God’s	children	need	to	know	what	the	Bible	 **teaches** about	angels	and	demons.
    a. The	battles	we	fight	are	not	against	fellow	believers	or	even	the	evil	people	of	the	world.	
       _For	our	struggle	is	not	against	flesh	and	blood,	but	against	the	rulers,	against	the	_
       _powers,	against	the	world	forces	of	this	darkness,	against	the	_ **_spiritual_** _forces	of	_
       _wickedness	in	the	heavenly	places_ .	Ephesians	6:12
    b. Demonic	powers	have	the	ability	to	bring	about	hindrances	and	 **delays** to	God’s	plans.	
       Daniel	10:13,	1	Thessalonians	2:18,	Revelation	2:10
    c. Thankfully,	God	can	 **override** any	demonic	or	satanic	influence	at	any	time.	God	and	
       Satan	are	not	equals.	Zechariah	3:2,	Luke	8:26- 39
    d. God	allows	Satan	and	his	demons	limited	powers	of	obstruction	and	rebellion	in	the	
       celestial	realms	just	as	he	allows	humans	limited	 **freedom** of	will	in	the	natural	realms.	
       Genesis	3:1-6,	Ephesians	2:2,	Revelation	12:9
    e. Within	the	 **parameters** of	His	sovereignty,	God	allows	both	demons	and	humans	
       freedom	to	express	their	own	free	will,	even	in	rebellion.	Job	1:7,	2	Corinthians	4:4,	1	
       Peter	5:8
    f. God	permits	Satan	and	his	demons	to	have	 **limited** power	over	humanity.	Satan	is	on	a	
       leash.	He	cannot	go	beyond	what	God	permits.	Job	1:12,	2:6
    g. Just	as	demons	influence	nations,	God	uses	his	own	angels	to	 **counter** what	Satan	does	
       (Dan	11:1).	When	demons	attack	and	hinder,	God’s	angels	often	assist	and	encourage.	
       Daniel	10
    h. You,	as	a	child	of	God,	are	not	to	become	passive,	or	even	a	pawn,	in	this	spiritual	battle.	
       Put	on	your	full	 **armor** and	stand.	Ephesians	6:11-13;	2	Tim. 2:24-26;	Acts	8:13,	22- 23





**XVI. Daniel	11:2-12:4 – Astonishing	Predictions**

**A. Introduction**

1. In	this	final	vision, Daniel	heard **ominous** prophecies	concerning	Israel’s	future	under	the	
    Greek	and	Persian	empires.	In	the	end	of	the	chapter	the	vision	jumped	to	a	yet-to-be-
    fulfilled	prophecy	about	the	Antichrist’s	rise	and	fall.
    a. Given	and	recorded	around	536	BC,	this	chapter	chronicles	in	amazing	detail	future	
       **events** that	would	happen	within	a	few	years	to	a	few	hundred	years	to	a	few	thousand	
       years.
    b. Throughout	Daniel	11	Israel	is	the	background focus obscured	in	the	 **crossfire** of	the	
       warring	Greek	nations	of	Syria	to	the	north	and	Egypt	to	the	south.
    c. Two	nations embroiled	in	conflict	at	the	beginning	of	the	chapter	morph	to	represent	
       global	players	in	a	worldwide,	Antichrist-dominated	conflict	at	the	end	of	the	chapter.	In	
       the	end,	the	nation	to	the	north	and	the	nation	to	the	south	no	longer	fight	each	other
       as	their	attention	turns	to	the	 **destruction** of	Israel.
    d. If	studied	and	believed,	this	information	would	have	been	invaluable	to	the	people	of	
       Israel	during	their	years	of	suffering	at	the	hands	of	the	Persian	and	Greek	empires,	
       especially during	the final	days	under	Antiochus	Epiphanes.	None	of	these	events	took	
       God	by	 **surprise** .	Isaiah	46:9- 10
    e. Just	like	Israel,	we	also	need	to	know	God	is	in	 **control** ,	especially	as	we	witness	
       escalating	chaos	as	the	 _times	of	the	Gentiles_ move	progressively	towards	their	end.
    f. Whenever	the	information	in	this	vision	negatively	 **affects** Israel,	the	prophecies	include	
       more	detail.
       1) Daniel	was	confused	about	the	disparity	between	news	from	Israel	concerning	the	
          cessation	of	the	temple	rebuilding	project	and	what	he	had	understood	from	the	
          previous	visions	in	the	book	of	Daniel.	The	details	he	is	about	to	receive	in	chapter	
          11	will	answer	his	 **questions**.
       2) Like	Daniel,	many	in	Israel	would	also	have	been	 **confused** and	this	vision	would	
          help	them.	 _Now	I	have	come	to	give	you	an	understanding	of	what	_ **_will	happen	to	_**
          **_your	people_** _in	the	latter	days	_ [of	the	70	sevens] _,	for	the	vision	pertains	to	the	days	_
          _yet	future._ Daniel	10:14
2. At	first	glance,	this	chapter	may	seem	 **unfocused** since	it	covers	Persia’s	decline,	gives	
    detailed	information	about	the	rise	and	fall	the	Greek	Empire,	and	then	jumps	headlong	
    into	the	final	stage	of	the	Roman	Empire.
    a. The	reason	is	simple.	This	prophecy	focuses	only	on	 **filling** in	important	details	specific	
       to	Daniel’s vision	of	the	70	weeks	(sevens).	Daniel	9:24- 27	






b. Daniel	11:2- 35	 – This	first	section	concerns	Israel’s	near	future.	It	finishes	more	or	less	
with	the	completion	of	the	69	weeks	(sevens)	foretold	in	Daniel	nine.	All	the	statements	
made	in	this	section	can been	 verified ,	almost	to	the	minutest	detail,	in	secular	history.	
The	probabilities	of	this	happening	by	chance are	mathematically	impossible.
1) In	all,	there	are	135	prophetic	statements	in	Daniel	11:2-35	that	have	already	been	
fulfilled	 accurately and	literally.	That’s	astounding.
2) If	Daniel	was	able	to	predict	these	future	events	with	such	pinpoint	accuracy,	we	
know	that	the	remaining	prophecies	will	likewise	be	fulfilled	 literally and	with	
perfect	accuracy.	Obviously,	we	will	not	understand	all	the	details	beforehand,	but	
we	can	have	a	pretty	good	preview	of	what	will	happen.
3) From	our	perspective	now,	the events	of	Daniel	11:2-35	are	actual	historical	
realities.	Their	verifiable	fulfillment	should	give	us	 confidence in	our	God,	who	not	
only	knows	everything,	but	who	loves	us	so	much	He	revealed	the	future	for	our	
encouragement	and	hope.	Revelation	1:1- 3
c. Daniel	11:36- 45	 – The	second	section	concerns	the	 distant future	and	the	appearance	of	
the	Antichrist	at	the	start	of	the	seventieth	week	(seven) declared	by	God	for	Israel	in	
Daniel	nine.
1) The	prophecies	in	Daniel	11:2-35	were	all	fulfilled	literally	before	the	Church	Age	
began.	In	Daniel	11:36-45	there	is	a	shift	to	prophecies	about	the	distant	future,	
after	the	Church	Age	has	finished,	that	relate	to	the	continuation	of	Israel’s	
declared	70	weeks	(sevens)	of	 discipline.
2) From	Daniel’s	perspective,	every	one	of	these	prophecies	were	future,	but	from	our	
perspective	some	have	already	been	fulfilled	literally	(Dan.	11:2-35)	and	some	still	
await	their	literal	fulfillment	(Dan.	11:36-45)	in	the	seven-year	 Tribulation.
3) Because	the	events	of	Daniel	11:36-45	are	still	future,	we	will	be	careful	to	not	be	
dogmatic	about	 unclear details.

3. The	great	majority	of	the	prophecies	made	in	the	first	35	verses	of	chapter	11	were	fulfilled	
    during	the	400	years	of	prophetic	silence	between	the	Old	and	New	Testaments.	Even	
    though	God	did	not	reveal	new	prophecy	during	this	time,	He	was	far	from	 **silent** .	Through	
    the	precise	fulfillment	of	Old	Testament	prophecies,	He	was	speaking	loudly	and	clearly.

**B. Daniel	11:2- 3	 – Prophecies	about	the	fall	of	Persia**

1. Daniel	11:2a	– _And	now	I	will	tell	you	the	_ **_truth_** _..._ The	angel	proceeded	with	his	true	message	
    sent	straight	from	the	throne	room	of	God.
2. Daniel	11:2b	– _...Behold,	three	more	kings	are	going	to	arise	in	Persia._ The	three	Persian	
    kings	that	 **ruled** after	Cyrus	were	Cambyses,	Pseudo-Smerdis,	and	Darius	I.	The	angel	raced	
    through	these	three	kings	to	get	to	the	one	king	who	would	cause	Middle	Eastern	history	to	
    change	dramatically.





3. Daniel	11:2c	– _...Then	a	fourth	will	gain	far	more	riches	than	all	of	them;	as	soon	as	he	_
    _becomes	strong	through	his	riches..._ King	Xerxes	I,	a	fourth	Persian	king	after	Cyrus,	became	
    stronger	and	 **wealthier** than	all	the	previous	kings	who	ruled.	Esther	1: 1 - 4
4. Daniel	11:2d	– _...he	will	arouse	the	whole	empire	against	the	realm	of	Greece._ In	480	BC,	
    King	Xerxes	I	amassed	a	million-man	army	and	a	huge	navy	to	lead	a	military	expedition	
    against	Greece.	More	than	anything,	his	unsuccessful	campaign	succeeded	in	making	the	
    Greeks	 **hate** the	Persians.
    a. Although	there	were	other	Persian	kings	after	King	Xerxes,	the	angel	stopped	his	
       preview	of	Persian	history	with	him.	He	would	be	the	 **catalyst** to	bring	Greek	(European)
       influence	to	bear	on	the	Middle	East.
    b. The	angel	now	jumped	90	years	forward	to	Greece’s	rapid	invasion	of	the	Middle	East.	A	
       mighty	king,	motivated	by	revenge,	would	be	set	on	conquering	the	 **world**.
5. Daniel	11:3	– _And	a	mighty	king	will	arise,	and	he	will	rule	with	great	authority	and	do	as	he	_
    _pleases._ This	 _mighty	king_ was	Alexander	the	 **Great** ,	who	under	the	banner	of	revenge,	
    quickly	conquered	the	Persian	Empire.	Since	this	did	not	directly	affect	Israel,	not	a	lot	more	
    detail	was	given	by	the	angel.

**C. Daniel	11:4- 18	 – Prophecies	about	the	Greek,	Syrian-Egyptian	wars**

1. Daniel	11:4a	– _But	as	soon	as	he	has	arisen,	his	kingdom	will	be	broken	up	and	parceled	out	_
    _toward	the	four	points	of	the	compass..._ In	323	BC,	upon	his	 **premature** death	in	Babylon,	
    Alexander’s	kingdom	was	divided.	His	two	sons, Hercules	and	Alexander, were	assassinated	
    and	his	only	uncle	murdered,	leaving	no	legitimate	heirs	to	the	throne.
2. Daniel	11:4b	– _...though	not	to	his	own	descendants,	nor	according	to	his	authority	which	he	_
    _wielded,	for	his	sovereignty	will	be	uprooted	and	given	to	others	besides	them._ Instead	of	
    being	given	to	his	heirs,	Alexander’s	kingdom	was	divided	among	his	top	four	generals:	
    Cassander,	Lysimachus,	Seleucus	(Syria),	and	Ptolemy	(Egypt).	Daniel	8
    a. For	nearly	two	centuries,	two	kingdoms	in	particular,	Syria	and	Egypt, fought	for	power	
       and	 **dominion**.-Seleucus	grew	more	
    powerful than	Ptolemy.

4. Daniel	11:6	– What	happened	next?


a. Daniel	11:6a	– After	some	years...	 refers	to	the	Syrian-Egyptian	wars	from	274- 27 1	BC	
and	260-253	BC.	These	wars	created	the	need	for	a	 truce.
b. Daniel	11:6b	– ...they	will	form	an	alliance... In	the	ancient	world,	 treaties between	
nations	were	sometimes	created	and	sealed	by	intermarrying	members	of	their	royal	
courts.
c. Daniel	11:6c	– ...and	the	daughter	of	the	king	of	the	South	will	come	to	the	king	of	the	
North	to	carry	out	a	peaceful	arrangement.	 The	king	of	Egypt,	Ptolemy	II,	gave	his	
daughter	Berenice	to	Antiochus	II,	king	of	Syria,	in	 marriage .	Ptolemy	II	was	favorable	to	
the	Jews,	even	authorizing	the	translation	of	the	Old	Testament	into	Greek	(Septuagint).
d. Daniel	11:6d	– But	she	will	not	retain	her	position	of	power,	nor	will	he	remain	with	his	
power,	but	she	will	be	given	up,	along	with	those	who	brought	her	in	and	the	one	who	
sired	her	as	well	as	he	who	supported	her	in	those	times. This	prophecy	is	somewhat	
hard	to	understand,	but	looking	back	in	 history it	becomes	understandable.
1) In	order	for	Berenice	to	be	married	to	Antiochus	II,	he	had	to	divorce	his	first	wife,	
Laodice.	After	the death	of	Berenice’s	father	in	Egypt,	Antiochus	II	 left her	and	
returned	to	his	former	wife,	Laodice.
2) It	is	said	Laodice	then	 poisoned Berenice,	her	bodyguards	( those	who	brought	her ),	
and	her	infant	son.	Later	she	may	also	have	poisoned	King	Antiochus	II	in	order	to	
put	her	own	son,	Seleucus	II,	on	the	throne.	All	of	this	led	to	the	third	Syrian-
Egyptian	War.

5. Daniel	11:7	– _But	one	of	the	descendants	of	her	line	will	arise	in	his	place,	and	he	will	come	_
    _against	their	army	and	enter	the	fortress	of	the	king	of	the	North,	and	he	will	deal	with	them	_
    _and	display	great	strength._ Berenice’s	brother,	Ptolemy	III,	ruled	Egypt	from	246-221	BC	and	
    started	the	third	war	with	Syria	when	Egypt	was	at	a	peak	of	power.
    a. Ptolemy	III	marched	his	armies	across	Israel	and	attacked	Syria	with	great	fury.	He	
       **defeated** Seleucus	II	and	avenged	the	death	and	shame	of	his	sister,	Berenice, by	killing	
       Laodice.
    b. This	started	a	string	of	continual	 **warfare** that	trampled	down	Israel	in	the	process.	





6. Daniel	11:8	– _Also	their	gods	with	their metal	images	and	their	precious	vessels	of	silver	and	_
    _gold	he	will	take	into	captivity	to	Egypt,	and	he	on	his	part	will	refrain	from	attacking	the	_
    _king	of	the	North	for	some	years._ After	this	victory,	Ptolemy	III	 **invaded** the	countryside	from	
    Syria	all	the	way	to	Babylon,	raiding	temples	and	bringing	their	idols	and	loot	back	to	Egypt.
7. Daniel	11:9	– _Then	the	latter	will	enter	the	realm	of	the	king	of	the	South,	but	will	return	to	_
    _his	own	land._ Seleucus	II	of	Syria	 **pursued** Ptolemy	III	back	to	Egypt	but	in	the	process	failed	
    to	gain	any	military	advantage.
    a. Nonetheless,	 **power** eventually	shifted	from	the	south	(Egypt)	to	the	north	(Syria).	It	is	
       curious	to	note	that	the	Ptolemaic	rulers of	Egypt were	more	pro-Israel	than	the	
       Seleucid	rulers of	Syria.
    b. Through	this	prophecy,	Israel	would	be	warned that	this **shift** in	power	did	not	signal	a	
       return	of	their	freedom.	During	these	times,	they	needed	to	be	careful	not	to	assume	
       that	an	overthrow	of	their	oppressors	meant	good	days	were	coming.
8. Daniel	11:10	– _His	sons	will	mobilize	and	assemble	a	multitude	of	great	forces;	and	one	of	_
    _them	will	keep	on	coming	and	overflow	and	pass	through,	that	he	may	again	wage	war	up	_
    _to	his	very	fortress._ The	phrase	“his	sons”	referred	to	the	 **sons** of	Seleucus	II	of	Syria.
    a. The	sons	of	the	Seleucid	(Syrian)	Empire	 **fought** on.
    b. _One	of	them,_ Antiochus	III,	had	a	grandiose	 **plan** to	once	again	conquer	all	of	
       Alexander’s	former	empire.
9. Daniel	11:11	– The	fourth	Syrian-Egyptian	war,	which	was	between	Antiochus	III	and	
    Ptolemy	IV, predicated	the	decline	of	Ptolemaic	Egypt.	Antiochus	III	would	later	become	
    known	as	Antiochus	the	Great.	He	attacked	Egypt	numerous	times	on	the	border	by Israel.	
    He	was	aided	by	 **Jewish** mercenaries	and	rebels	who	wanted	to	throw	off	Ptolemaic	rule.
    a. Daniel	11:11a	– _The	king	of	the	South	will	be	enraged	and	go	forth	and	fight	with	the	_
       _king	of	the	North.	_ **Angered** that	his	power	was	threatened	by	Antiochus	III’s	grandiose	
       ideas	of	world	domination,	Ptolemy	IV	organized	the	Egyptian	army	for	war.
    b. Daniel	11:11b	– _Then	the	latter	_ [Syria]	 _will	raise	a	great	multitude..._ Antiochus	III	likewise	
       raise	a	vast	 **army** and	led	it down	to	the	coastline	just	south	of	Gaza.
    c. Daniel	11:11c	– _...but	that	multitude	will	be	given	into	the	hand	of	the	former_ [Egypt]_._
       Just	as	prophesied,	Ptolemy	IV	(Egypt)	remarkably	 **defeated** Antiochus	III	(Syria).
10. Daniel	11:12	– _When	the	multitude	is	carried	away,	his	heart	will	be	lifted	up,	and	he	will	_
    _cause	tens	of	thousands	to	fall;	yet	he	will	not	prevail._ For	some	reason,	Ptolemy	did	not	
    take	advantage	of	his	victory	to	 **pursue** Antiochus III.	Humanly	speaking	this	was	a	foolish	
    mistake;	it	allowed	Antiochus	to	regroup	and	regain	the	advantage.
11. Daniel	11:13	– _For	the	king	of	the	North	will	again	raise	a	greater	multitude	than the	former,	_
    _and	after	an	interval	of	some	years	he	will	press	on	with	a	great	army	and	much	equipment._
    Ptolemy’s	failure	to	finish	off	Antiochus	the	Great’s	armies	gave	Antiochus	the	reprieve	
    needed	to	 **reinforce** his	military	and	go	after	Ptolemy	as	Daniel 11:10	predicted.





12. Daniel	11:14a	– _Now	in	those	times	many	will	rise	up	against	the	king	of	the	South;	the	_
    _violent	ones	among	your	people	will	also	lift	themselves	up	in	order	to	fulfill	the	vision..._
    Zealous	 **Jewish** fighters,	wanting	to	fulfill	the	 _vision_ (a	possible	reference	to	the	Kingdom	of	
    God,	or	simply	a	misunderstanding	of	this	vision),	helped	Syria	against	Egypt	(Ptolemy).
13. Daniel	11:14b	– _...but	they	will	fall	down._ These	zealous	Jews	ended	up	bringing	greater	
    suffering	to	Israel.	The	northern	Seleucid	Syrian	Greeks	were	not	going	to	treat	them	any	
    better	than	the	southern	Ptolemaic	Egyptian	Greeks;	quite	the	contrary.	Israel	was	
    **misguidedly** asking	for	trouble.
14. Daniel	11:15	– _Then	the	king	of	the	North	will	come,	cast	up	a	siege	ramp	and	capture	a	_
    _well-fortified	city;	and	the	forces	of	the	South	will	not	stand	their	ground,	not	even	their	_
    _choicest	troops,	for	there	will	be	no	strength	to	make	a	stand._ Antiochus	III	defeated	the	
    Egyptians	in	the	Battle	of	Panium.	This	relaxed	the	Ptolemaic	 **grip** on	Israel.
15. Daniel	11:16	– _But	he	who	comes	against	him	will	do	as	he	pleases,	and	no	one	will	be	able	_
    _to	withstand	him;	he	will	also	stay	for	a	time	in	the	Beautiful	Land,	with	destruction	in	his	_
    _hand._ With	this	victory	over	Ptolemy,	Antiochus	III	gained	control	of	Israel,	 _the	Beautiful	_
    _Land_ .	In	hopes of	 **freedom** ,	Israel	trusted	Antiochus	III,	but	he	was	not	a true friend.
16. Daniel	11:17a	– _He	will	set	his	face	to	come	with	the	power	of	his	whole	kingdom,	bringing	_
    _with	him	a	proposal	of	peace	which	he	will	put	into	effect...._ Antiochus	III	would	have	liked	
    to	conquer	Egypt,	but	because	a	new	power	was	rising	in	the	northwest	(Rome),	he	instead	
    sought	an	alliance	of	 **peace** with	Egypt.
17. Daniel	11:17b	– _...he	will	also	give	him	the	daughter	of	women	to	ruin	it.	But	she	will	not	_
    _take	a	stand	for	him	or	be	on	his	side._ Antiochus	the	Great	gave	his	daughter	Cleopatra	I	to	
    Ptolemy	V	in	marriage	in	hopes	that	Cleopatra	would	act	as	a	 **spy** on	his	behalf.	Instead	
    Cleopatra	turned	on	her	father	and	was	loyal	to	her	husband.
18. Daniel	11:18a – _Then	he	will	turn	his	face	to	the	coastlands	and	capture	many._ Antiochus	
    III’s	last	major	military	 **campaign** focused	on	Cypress,	Crete	and	Greece.
19. Daniel	11:18b	– _But	a	commander	will	put	a	stop	to	his	scorn	against	him;	moreover,	he	will	_
    _repay	him	for	his	scorn._ This	 **Roman** commander	was	Scipio	Asiaticus	who	defeated	
    Antiochus	III	at	the	Battle	of	Magnesia.
    a. Out	of	this	battle	came	the	Treaty	of	Apamea	with	its	devastating	 **conditions** for	Greek-
       Syria,	which	included	leaving	Europe,	giving	up	all	war	elephants,	and	paying	Rome	an	
       exorbitant	amount	of	gold.
    b. This	treaty	impacted	the	future	of	Antiochus	IV	(Epiphanes),	the	son	of	Antiochus (III)	
       the	Great.	Antiochus	IV	was	taken	to	Rome	as	a	political	 **hostage**.

**D. Daniel	11:19- 32	 – A	close	look	at	Antiochus	IV	Epiphanes**

1. Daniel	11:19	– _So	he	will	turn	his	face	toward	the	fortresses	of	his	own	land,	but	he	will	_
    _stumble	and	fall	and	be	found	no	more._ Because	of	the	heavy	demands	of	the	treaty	with	
    Rome,	Antiochus	III	raided	temples	in	his	own	lands.	On	one	such	raid,	he tripped	and	fell,	
    resulting	in	a	 **fatal** injury	- not	a	very	glorious	way	for	a	festooned	conqueror	to	die.	





2. Daniel	11:20a	– _Then	in	his	place	one	will	arise	who	will	send	an	oppressor	through	the	Jewel	_
    _of	his	kingdom..._ Seleucus	IV,	Antiochus	Epiphanes’	brother,	replaced	Antiochus	III.	He	ruled	
    Greek-Syria	less	than	ten	years,	from	187	to	175	BC,	and	heavily	 **taxed** Israel	to	pay	tribute	
    to	Rome.
    a. The	only	temple	not	already	raided	in	his	country	was	the	Jewish	 **temple** in	Jerusalem.
    b. Seleucus	IV	sent	his	tax	collector,	Heliodors,	to	 **raid** the	temple,	but	because	of	divine	
       intervention	he	and	his	men	returned	with	nothing.
3. Daniel	11:20b	– _...yet	within	a	few	days	he	will	be	shattered,	though	not	in	anger	nor	in	_
    _battle_ .	Shortly	after	the	temple	episode,	Seleucus	IV	dropped	 **dead**. Some	credit	Heliodors	
    (possibly	Jewish)	with	having	poisoned	Seleucus	IV.	Whatever	the	case,	his death	paved	the	
    way	for	Antiochus	IV	to	readily	grab	the	throne.
4. Daniel	11:21a	– _In	his	place	a	despicable	person	will	arise..._ Although	Antiochus	IV	was	a	
    **hostage** in	Rome,	he	had	been released	in	exchange	for	Demetrius,	the	legitimate	heir	to	
    the	Seleucid	throne.
    a. We	note	that	the	angel	referred	to	this	person (Antiochus	IV)	as	a	vile	or	 **despicable**
       person.	Why	might	this	be?
    b. This	man	is	the	little	horn	of	Daniel	8:9-14.	In	this	passage,	he	is	prophesied	to	become	
       the	 _King	of	the	North_ .	He	is	the	one	 _who	is	insolent	and	full	of	_ **_intrigue_** in	Daniel	8:23-26.
    c. He	renamed	himself	Antiochus	Epiphanes,	meaning	Antiochus	God- **Manifest** .	Jews	in	his	
       kingdom	secretly	called	him	Antiochus	Epiphanes,	meaning	Antiochus	the	Madman.
    d. He	came	to	power	in	the	final	days	of	the	Greek	Empire	when	Rome	was	rising	as	the	
       new	world	power. Antiochus	put	heavy	demands	on	 **Israel**.
    e. Why	might	the	angel	have	given	so	much	information	(Dan.	11:21-35)	about	one	 **king** to	
       Daniel?
       1) Because	this	man	was a	small-scale	 **forerunner** of	the	coming,	vile-beyond-
          imagination,	Antichrist.
       2) Because	this	man	singled out	Israel	and	Jerusalem	as	the	 **object** of	his	fury	and	
          wrath	as	a	foretaste	of	the	coming	wrath	the	Antichrist	will	express	against	Israel.
5. Daniel	11:21b	– _...on	whom	the	honor	of	kingship	has	not	been	conferred,	but	he	will	come	_
    _in	a	time	of	tranquility	and	seize	the	kingdom	by	intrigue._ With	the	legitimate	heir	to	the	
    Seleucid	Empire	now	held	hostage	in	Rome,	Antiochus	(IV)	Epiphanes	seized	the	 **throne**.
6. Daniel	11:22a	– _The	overflowing	forces	will	be	flooded	away	before	him	and	shattered..._ In	
    172	BC,	Antiochus’	forces	 **defeated** Ptolemy	VI.
7. Daniel	11:22b	– _...and	also	the	prince	of	the	covenant._ With	Israel’s	lands	under	his	
    jurisdiction,	Antiochus	Epiphanes	became	involved	in	Jewish	 **religious** affairs.
    a. On	his	way	through	Israel,	Antiochus Epiphanes **deposed** and	killed	the	High	Priest.






b. Upon	removal	of	the	legitimate	High	Priest	and	in	disregard	of	God’s	 Levitical code,	
Antiochus	Epiphanes	appointed	a	pseudo-high	priest	(Jason),	who	paid	Antiochus	a	large	
sum	of	money	for	the	position.

8. Daniel	11:23- 24	 – At	the	time, Antiochus Epiphanes’	 **nephew** ,	Ptolemy	VI,	the	son	of	his	
    famous	sister	Cleopatra,	ruled	Egypt.	
    a. Daniel	11:23	– _After	an	alliance	is	made	with	him	he	will	practice	deception,	and	he	will	_
       _go	up	and	gain	power	with	a	small	force	of	people._ Antiochus	IV	defeated	the	Egyptians,	
       but	to	keep	Rome	from	being	 **alarmed** ,	he	made	a	treaty	with	his	nephew,	Ptolemy	VI,	
       leaving	him	in	Egypt	as	a	vassal	king.
    b. Daniel	11:24a – _In	a	time	of	tranquility	he	will	enter	the	richest	parts	of	the	realm,	and	_
       _he	will	accomplish	what	his	fathers	never	did,	nor	his	ancestors..._ Antiochus	Epiphanes	
       was	now	free	to	pillage.	He	marched unchecked	on	the	delta	region	of	 **Egypt** ,	something	
       never	previously	done	by	the	Syrian	kings.
    c. Daniel	11:24b	– _he	will	distribute	plunder,	booty	and	possessions	among	them,	and	he	_
       _will	devise	his	schemes	against	strongholds,	but	only	for	a	time._ Antiochus	(IV)	Epiphanes
       generously	 **gave** the	loot	from	this	victory	to	his	allies,	ensuring	their	future	support.
9. Daniel	11:25- 27	 – Treachery	in	Egypt


a. Daniel	11:25a	– He	will	stir	up	his	strength	and	courage	against	the	king	of	the	South	
with	a	large	army... Once	again	Antiochus	entered	Egypt.	Egypt’s	army	met	his	large	
army	at	Pelusium	near	the	delta	of	the	 Nile.
b. Daniel	11:25b	– ...so	the	king	of	the	South	will	mobilize	an	extremely	large	and	mighty	
army	for	war;	but	he	will	not	stand,	for	schemes	will	be	devised	against	him. Someone	
within	his	own	ranks,	maybe	his	own	brother,	caused	Ptolemy’s	 defeat.
c. Daniel	11:26a	– Those	who	eat	his	choice	food	will	destroy	him... Within	the	king’s	family	
( those	who	eat	his	choice	food )	there	was	a	 traitor.
d. Daniel	11:26b	– ...and	his	army	will	overflow,	but	many	will	fall	down	slain. Ptolemy	VII’s	
men	 mutinied ,	explaining	the	defeat	of	Egypt’s	mighty	army.
e. Daniel	11:27a	– As	for	both	kings,	their	hearts	will	be	intent	on	evil,	and	they	will	speak	
lies	to	each	other	at	the	same	table... After	this	defeat,	Ptolelmy	VII	and	Antiochus	
Epiphanes	sat	down	together,	and	apparently, Antiochus	expressed	a	desire	for	
friendship	with	Egypt,	but	that	distrustful goal	was	never	 attained.
f. Daniel	11:27b	– ...but	it	will	not	succeed,	for	the	end	is	still	to	come	at	the	appointed	
time. Seated	at	the	same	table,	both	kings	simply	 deceived each	other.	Antiochus	
returned	home	with	great	amounts	of	spoils.

10. Daniel	11:28	– _Then	he	will	return	to	his	land	with	much	plunder;	but	his	heart	will	be	set	_
    _against	the	holy	covenant,	and	he	will	take	action	and	then	return	to	his	own	land_ .	On	his	
    way	home,	Antiochus	Epiphanes	made	a	 **significant** stop	in	Jerusalem.






a. Through	bribery,	Antiochus	had	appointed	Jason	as	high	priest.	Later	he	replaced	Jason	
with	yet	another	illegitimate	priest,	Menelaus,	a	Hellenistic	Israelite,	maybe	even	from	
the	tribe	of	Benjamin.	Menelaus	encouraged	Antiochus	to	Hellenize	Jerusalem,	meaning	
to	force	Israel to	accept	 Greek ways.
b. While	Antiochus	was	away	fighting	in	Egypt,	Jason	appointed	himself	as	ruler	of	
Jerusalem,	forcing	Menelaus	into	hiding.	It	is	said	that	when	Antiochus	stopped	in	
Jerusalem	on	his	way	home	from	Egypt,	Menelaus	 aided him	in	sacking	the	city,	killing	
multitudes,	and	plundering	the	temple.

11. Daniel	11:29	– _At	the	appointed	time	he	will	return	and	come	into	the	South,	but	this	last	_
    _time	it	will	not	turn	out	the	way	it	did	before._ Antiochus	(VI)	Epiphanes was	growing	
    stronger	and	once	again	his	eyes	were	set	on	conquering	Egypt.	This	fact	alarmed	Rome.	
    Therefore,	Rome	planned	to	 **foil** Antiochus	IV’s	plans.
12. Daniel	11:30a – _For	ships	of	Kittim	will	come	against	him;	therefore	he	will	be	disheartened	_
    _and	will	return..._ According	to	history,	a	Roman dignitary	delivered	Antiochus	an	ultimatum	
    of	 **war** with	Rome	if	he	again	attacked	Egypt.	Daniel	8:12
13. Daniel	11:30b	– _...therefore	he	will	be	disheartened	and	will	return	and	become	enraged	at	_
    _the	holy	covenant	and	take	action..._ In	his	disgrace,	Antiochus	Epiphanes	turned	his	 **anger**
    against	Israel.
14. Daniel	11:30c	–... _so	he	will	come	back	and	show	regard	for	those	who	forsake	the	holy	_
    _covenant._ The	only	group	that	escaped	his	wrath	were	those	Jews	who	 **denied** God	and	the	
    Mosaic	Law	in	favor	of	Greek	culture	and	customs.
15. Daniel	11:31a	– _Forces	from	him	will	arise..._ Under	the	guise	of	a	military	parade,	Antiochus’	
    army	marched	22,000	soldiers	along	the	north	wall	of	Jerusalem.	Then	they	unexpectedly	
    breached	the	north	wall	and	 **massacred** thousands	upon	thousands	of	Israelites.
16. Daniel	11:31b	– _...desecrate	the	sanctuary	fortress	and	do	away	with	the	regular	sacrifice.	_
    _And	they	will	set	up	the	abomination	of	desolation_ .		On	December	15,	167	BC,	Antiochus	
    Epiphanes	entered	the	temple	and	set	up	an	altar	to	 **Zeus** on	top	of	the	Altar	of	Sacrifice.
    a. This	evil	event	left	the	temple	completely	unusable	for	sacrifice.	It	was the	first	
       **abomination** that	caused	the	temple to	be	desolate,	and	foreshadowed a	similar	
       prophesied	event	that	will	occur	during	the	Tribulation.
    b. We	know	this	is not	the	same	event	mentioned	in	Daniel	9:27,	because	almost	200	years	
       after	this	event	 **Jesus** quoted	the	Daniel	reference	as	still	being	future:	“ _Therefore	when	_
       _you	see	the	ABOMINATION	OF	DESOLATION	which	was	spoken	of	through	Daniel	the	_
       _prophet,	standing	in	the	holy	place	(let	the	reader	understand)_ .”
17. Daniel	11:32a – _By	smooth	words	he	will	turn	to	godlessness	those	who	act	wickedly	toward	_
    _the	covenant..._ Antiochus	Epiphanes	deceived	many	Jews	into	sacrificing	on	the	altar	of	
    Zeus.	Antiochus	actively	sought	to	 **extinguish** all	traces	of	truth	by	destroying	every	copy	of	
    the	Law	of	Moses.	He	sent	soldiers	from	house	to	house	searching	for	copies	to	destroy.





18. Daniel	11:32b	– _...but	the	people	who	know	their	God	will	display	strength	and	take action._
    These	were	Jews	who	took	their	stand	for	God	and	willingly	 **died** for	their	faith	in	the	
    Maccabean	Revolt	against	Antiochus.

**E. Daniel	11:33- 35	 – The	times	of	the	Maccabean	Revolt	(167-160	BC)**

1. Introduction:	The	events	foretold	by	the	angel	in	verses	33-35	are	recorded	in	 **detail** in	the	
    non-canonical	book	of	2	Maccabees.
2. Daniel	11:33a – _Those	who	have	insight	among	the	people	will	give	understanding	to	the	_
    _many..._ There	were	some	Jewish	 **teachers** who	tried	to	help	the	people	of	Israel	stand	
    through	the	difficult	days	of	the	reign	of	Antiochus	Epiphanes.
3. Daniel	11:33b – _...yet	they	will	fall	by	sword	and	by	flame,	by	captivity	and	by	plunder	for	_
    _many	days._ Many	Jews	were	martyred,	others	enslaved	and	robbed	by	the	 **cruel** methods	of	
    sword	and	flame.	There	was	great	suffering	leading	up	to	and	during	the	years	of	the	revolt.
4. Daniel	11:34a	– _Now	when	they	fall	they	will	be	granted	a	little	help..._ As	persecution	
    mounted,	the	Maccabean	 **revolt** began	to	gain	ground.
5. Daniel	11:34b	– _...and	many	will	join	with	them	in	hypocrisy._ Yet	nonetheless	many	Jewish	
    people	of	the	day	simply	followed	Antiochus’	evil	 **demands** and	apostatized.
6. Daniel	11:35a	– _Some	of	those	who	have	insight	will	fall..._ During	Antiochus	Epiphanes’	reign	
    of	terror,	 **believers** ( _those	who	have	insight_ )	suffered	and	died.
7. Daniel	11:35b	– _...in	order	to	refine,	purge	and	make	them	pure	until	the	end	time..._ God	
    used	this	persecution	to	 **prepare** Israel	for	the	end	of	the	69th	week	of	sevens	when	Christ	
    would	come,	presenting	Himself	to	them	as	Messiah	and	King.	John	12:15
8. Daniel	11:35c	– _...because	it	is	still	to	come	at	the	appointed	time._ The	angel	prophesied	that	
    this	time	of	testing	would	 **end** ,	and	it	did	when	Antiochus Epiphanes died	in	163	BC.	He	died	
    on	a	military	campaign	into	Persia.	It	is	said	he	died	of	insanity.

**F. Daniel	11:36- 45	 – Daniel’s	70th week	reintroduced**

1. Although	Daniel	11:2-35	is	a	 **complex** and	difficult	passage,	with	the	help	of	extra-biblical	
    recorded	history	we	now	have	a	fairly	concrete	understanding	of	those	verses.	Those	verses	
    prophesied	key	events	pertaining	to	Israel	that	would	happen	during	the	often	difficult	days	
    of	the	69	weeks	(sevens)	leading	up	to	Christ.
2. As	we	come	to	this	next	section,	we	note	that	between	verses	35	and	36	there	is	an	 **interval**
    of	more	than	two	thousand	years.
3. From	Daniel	11:36	forward	we	proceed	into	 **uncharted** waters.	The	following	section	does	
    not	reflect	any	known	historical	past	events.	That	is	because	these	verses	are	yet	future.
4. We	will	give	our	views	on	this	section,	realizing	that	we	may	be	wrong,	as	our	knowledge	
    and	insight	are	limited.	But	we	can	be	sure	that	God	is	 **sovereign** over	all	that	happens.	We	
    can	rest,	knowing	that,	just	as	God	foreknew	and	controlled	the	intricate	details	of	Israel’s	
    past	history,	He	has	the	future	under	control	as	well.





5. Just	as	Jesus	was	born	at	exactly	the	right	time	(Gal.	4:4),	we	can	be	assured	that	Christ	will	
    return	at	the	perfect	time	and	will	indeed	 **rule** from	sea	to	sea	over	the	entire	human	race.
6. Who	has	the	 **right** to	rule,	God	or	Satan?	The	book	of	Daniel	assures	us	that	God	does.	In
    the	end,	God	will	dominate	and	rule	over	all	creation.
7. In	this	study	through	the	pages	of	Daniel,	we	have	been	trailing	a	dark	figure	who	will	rise	to	
    power	in	the	last	days.	He	will	be	the	last	in	a	long	line	of	evil	rulers	who	have	controlled	the	
    sinful	kingdoms	of	men.	This	is	the	 **Antichrist**.
    a. He	was	first	introduced	in	Daniel	seven	as	the	 **boastful** and	blasphemous	little	horn.
    b. In	Daniel	eight,	he	was	prefigured	in	Antiochus	Epiphanes,	the	 **Greek** little	horn.
    c. In	Daniel	nine,	he	was	predicted	as	being	a	 **deceptive** ,	double-crossing	world	leader	who	
       will	treacherously	promise	Israel	protection	only	to	turn	on	Israel	in	all-out	genocide.
    d. Here	we	have	the	revelation	of	a	rising	global	 **con	man** who	races	to	save	the	day	for	
       Israel	only	to	turn	and	devour	the	nation	by	every	possible	means.
8. Some	questions	eat	at	our	curiosity.	Who	is	the	Antichrist?	Where	does	he	come	from?	How	
    does	he	rise to	power?	When	does	he	appear?	Who	is	behind	his	rise	to	power?	What	are	
    his	goals?	Sadly,	most	of	these	questions	are	not	answered	here.	Like	the	serpent	in	the	
    garden,	he	simply	seems	to	 **appear** on	the	scene.
    a. In	verses	36-39,	we	will	see	how	the	Antichrist will consolidate	his	 **power** and	begin	his	
       global	rule.
    b. In	this	passage,	Israel	will	move from	being	protected	to	being	persecuted.	This	will	
       happen during	the	Tribulation (Rev. 6:17),	the	time	of	Jacob’s	 **trouble** .	Jeremiah	30:7,	

**G. Daniel	11:36- 39	 – The	character	of	the	Antichrist**

1. Daniel	11:36a	– _Then	the	king	will	do	as	he	pleases..._ Quite	 **abruptly** a	new	personage	is	
    inserted	into	our	passage.	This	perhaps, is	exactly	how	he	will	appear	on	the	scene	in	the	
    last	days.
    a. This	cannot	be	Antiochus	Epiphanes	because	he	did	not	always	get	to	do	as	he	pleased.	
       Daniel	11:29-30	graphically	portrayed	him	being	 **denied** what	he	wanted.
    b. On	the	contrary,	this	 _king_ who	 _does	as	he	_ **_pleases_** is	identifiable	as	the	Antichrist.
       1) In	1	John	2:18,	he	is	called	the	 **Antichrist**.
       2) In	Revelation	13:1-10,	he	is	identified	as	the	 **beast**.
       3) In	2	Thessalonians	2:3,	he	is	called	the	man	of	 **lawlessness** .	The	Antichrist	will	make	
          his	own	laws,	while	at	the	same	time	being	subject	to	no	one’s	laws.
       4) In	2	Thessalonians	2:3,	he	is	also	referred	to	as	the	son	of	 **destruction** .	Just	like	his	
          father	the	devil,	the	Antichrist	will	bring	destruction on	every	side.
    c. This	king	will	 _do	as	he	_ **_pleases_** ...	The	Antichrist	will	be	the	ultimate	expression	of	
       arrogance	with his self-appointed	authority.





2. Daniel	11:36b	– _...and	he	will	exalt	and	_ **_magnify_** _himself	above	every	god	..._ The	Antichrist	
    will	put	himself	on	a	level	above	all	gods.
    a. He	will	be	an	evil	global	political	 **despot** ,	unmatched	by	any	previous	world	ruler	to	ever	
       have	appeared	on	the	scene.	2	Thessalonians	2:1- 12
    b. The	closest	parallel	to	him	is	Antiochus	Epiphanes,	the	 **murderous** little	horn	of	Greece.	
       Daniel	8:22- 26
3. Daniel	11:36b	– _...and	will	speak	_ **_monstrous_** _things	against	the	God	of	gods..._ He	will	say	
    crazy,	unbelievable	things	against	the	God	of	Scripture.	Daniel	7:8,	11;	Revelation	13:5- 6
4. Daniel	11:36b	– _...and	he	will	prosper	until	the	indignation	is	finished,	for	that	which	is	_
    _decreed	will	be	done._ He	will	be	 **allowed** to	live	until	the	end	of	the	Tribulation,	at	which	
    time	he	will	be	destroyed	by	the	coming	of	Christ.	Isaiah	10:5,	13:5;	Revelation	19:20- 21
5. Daniel	11:37a	– _He	will	show	no	regard	for	the	gods	of	his	fathers._ The	Antichrist	will	
    **disregard** all	religious	traditions.	Although	he	will	use	religion	to	his	advantage,	in	the	end	
    he	will	destroy	all	worship	except	that	which	is	directed	at him.	Revelation	17:8
6. Daniel	11:37b	– _...or	for	the	desire	of	women...._ Since	all	Jewish	 **women** have	historically	
    desired	to	carry	and	birth	the	Messiah,	this	may	be	a	reference	to	the	fact	that	the	
    Antichrist	will	reject	Messiah.	Genesis	3:15
7. Daniel	11:37c	– _...nor	will	he	show	regard	for	any	other	god;	for	he	will	magnify	himself	_
    _above	them	all._ The Antichrist	will	be	an	 **atheist** ;	he	will	have	no	use	for	the	worship	of	any	
    god.	In	time,	he	will	view	himself	as	the	ultimate god	and	will	blaspheme	the	true	God.
8. Daniel	11:38a	– _But	instead	he	will	honor	a	god	of	fortresses	a	god	whom	his	fathers	did	not	_
    _know	..._ Honoring	 _a	god	of	fortresses_ does	not	mean	the	Antichrist	will	suddenly	get	religion.	
    It	does	mean	he	will	have	a	god	after	all,	that	god	being	his	own	 **military** strength	and	
    might.	That’s	where	he	will	put	his	trust.
9. Daniel	11:38b	– _...he	will	honor	him	with	gold,	silver,	costly	stones	and	treasures._ He	will	
    lavish worship on	his	 **army** by	giving	it	whatever	is	necessary	to	make	it	strong,	powerful,	
    and	prosperous.
10. Daniel	11:39a	– _He	will	take	action	against	the	strongest	of	fortresses	with	the	help	of	a_
    _foreign	god..._ While	he	is	an	atheist	himself,	if	it	is	to	his	 **advantage** to	exploit	the	god	or	
    religion	of	other	nations	to	wage	and	win	wars,	he	will	most	certainly	do	so.
11. Daniel	11:39b	– _...he	will	give	great	honor	to	those	who	acknowledge	him	and	will	cause	_
    _them	to	rule	over	the	many...	_ The	Antichrist	will	reward	those	who	“worship”	or	 **follow** him.
12. Daniel	11:39c	– _...and	will	parcel	out	land	for	a	price_ .	He	will	let	people	have	rule	over	
    **regions** if	they	are	loyal	to	him	and	his	cause.

**H. Daniel	11:40- 45	 – The	warring	of	the	Antichrist**

1. Daniel	11:40a – _At	the	_ **_end_** _time...	_ This	refers	to	Daniel’s	70th week	(seven)	which	is	the	
    seven-year	Tribulation	period.





2. Daniel	11:40b – _At	the	end	time	the	king	of	the	South	will	collide	with	him,	and	the	king	of	_
    _the	North	will	storm	against	him	with	chariots,	with	horsemen	and	with	many	ships..._ Up	to	
    this	point	in	the	chapter,	the	king	of	the	South	has	been	from	Egypt	and	the	king	of	the	
    North	from	Syria.	There	is	no	reason	to	 **change** these	designations	now.
    a. These	two	nations	will	 _collide_ with	the	Antichrist.	Since	the	historical	 **battleground** of	
       these	two	kings	was	Israel,	that	is	where	they	will	head.
    b. As	stated	in	Daniel	9:27,	the	Antichrist	will	have	already	 **allied** himself	with	Israel	
       contractually,	“ _And	he	will	make	a	firm	covenant	with	the	many	for	one	week_ ...”
3. Daniel	11:40c – _...and	he	will	enter	countries,	overflow	them	and	pass	through._ When	Israel
    gets	attacked	from	both	the	north	and	the	south,	the	Antichrist	will	respond	by	advancing	
    from	across	many	 **countries** .	It	is	interesting	to	note	in	verse	41	that	as	he	advances	he	will	
    exclude	the	area	of	Jordan	from	his	invasions.
4. Daniel	11:41a – _He	will	also	enter	the	Beautiful	Land	..._ The	Antichrist	will	attack	and	fight	
    off	the	two	kings	that	have	come	against	Israel.	He	will	enter	the	Promised	Land	under	the	
    **pretext** of	saving	Israel	from	their	enemies.
5. Daniel	11:41b – _...and	many	countries	will	fall..._ In	his	defense	of	Israel,	the	Antichrist	will	
    **overpower** Syria	and	Egypt,	along	with	many	other	countries	aligned	with	them.	These may	
    be	two	of	the	three	nations	he	will	uproot. “ _Behold,	another	horn,	a	little	one,	came	up	_
    _among	them,	and	three	of	the	first	horns	were	pulled	out	by	the	roots	before	it_ .”	Daniel	7:8
6. Daniel	11:41c – _...but	these	will	be	rescued	out	of	his	hand:	Edom,	Moab	and	the	foremost	of	_
    _the	sons	of	Ammon._ The	area	spared	here	is	modern	day	Jordan. That	is	one	area	where	
    Israel	is	likely	to	take	 **refuge** when	the	Antichrist	commits	the	abomination	of	desolation	at	
    the	midpoint	of	the	Tribulation.	Daniel	9:27,	Matthew	24:15- 22
7. Daniel	11:42	– _Then	he	will	stretch	out	his	hand	against	other	countries,	and	the	land	of	_
    _Egypt	will	not	escape._ Next	the	Antichrist	will	go	on	the	 **offensive** .		In	his	aggression, he	will	
    not	spare	Egypt.	He	will	also fight	against _other	countries_ (possibly countries	that	were	
    aligned	with	Egypt	and	Syria	in	their	attacks	on	Israel).
8. Daniel	11:43a – _But	he	will	gain	control	over	the	hidden	treasures	of	gold	and	silver	and	over	_
    _all	the	precious	things	of	Egypt..._ The	Antichrist	will	gain	control	of	Egypt’s	 **wealth** (possibly	
    their	entire	banking	system)	as	well	as	its	natural	resources	( _all	the	precious	things_ ).
9. Daniel	11:43b – _...and	Libyans	and	Ethiopians	will	follow	at	his	heels._ Libya	and	Ethiopia	will	
    come	under	his	 **control**.
10. Daniel	11:44	– _But	rumors	from	the	East	and	from	the	North	will	disturb	him,	and	he	will	go	_
    _forth	with	great	wrath	to	destroy	and	annihilate	many._ While	in	Egypt,	the	Antichrist	will	
    hear	of	threatening **reports** that	emanate	from	the	north	and	the	east.
    a. Since	most	of	the	nations	that	will	be part	of	the	coming	 **Battle** of	Gog	and	Magog will	
       be	from	the	north	and	east	of	Israel,	this	verse	could	be	referring	to	that	battle,	
       although	the	text	is	not	clear.






b. At	any	rate,	when	the	Antichrist	hears	these	rumors,	he	will	leave	Egypt	in	 pursuit of	the	
nations	 from	the	East	and	from	the	North .	His	goal	will	be	to	destroy	them.

11. Daniel	11:45a – _He	will	pitch	the	tents	of	his	royal	pavilion	between	the	seas	and	the	_
    _beautiful	Holy	Mountain..._ Jerusalem,	or	the	nearby	vicinity,	will	become	a	major	military	
    **headquarters** of	the	Antichrist’s	worldwide	empire.
    a. For	some	reason,	instead	of	doing	battle	as	he	planned,	the	Antichrist	will	set	up	his	
       **military** command, centered somewhere	between	the	Mediterranean	and	the	Dead	
       seas.	This	may	be	in	Jerusalem	or	somewhere	nearby.
    b. If	the	rumors	he	heard	while	in	Egypt	refer to	the	Battle	of	Gog	and	Magog,	it	may	be	
       that	when	the	Antichrist	goes	back	north	into	Israel,	he	will	find	that	the	nations	from	
       the	north	and	east	of	Israel	have	already	been	 **destroyed** .	If	that	is	indeed	the	case, it	
       will	have	been	God	who	destroyed	them.
    c. At	this	point	in	the	Tribulation,	Israel	will	likely	see	the	Antichrist	as	a	great	 **hero** who	
       rescued	them	from	their	enemies.	If	this	is	so,	it	may	pave	the	way	for	Israel	to	deem	
       him	as	a	“messiah.”
    d. Although	we	know	from	Scripture	that	the	Antichrist	will	 **turn** on	Israel	at	the	midpoint	
       of	the	Tribulation	(Dan.	9:27),	up	till	this	point	they	will	see	him	as	a great	savior.
12. Daniel	11:45b – _...yet	he	will	come	to	his	end,	and	no	one	will	help	him._ This	may	refer	to	the	
    Antichrist’s	death	(or	near	death	experience)	and	resuscitation,	an	event	which	will	happen	
    near	the	 **midpoint** of	the	Tribulation.	What	does	the	Antichrist	do	from	the	midpoint	
    onward,	after	his	resuscitation?	Revelation	13:3,	12;	17:11.
    a. The	world	will	follow	him	because	he	will	have	been	given	a	supernatural	resuscitation.	
       _His fatal	wound	was	_ **_healed_** _.	And	the	whole	earth was	amazed and	followed after	the_
       _beast_ .	Revelation	13:3
    b. The	world	will	openly	 **worship** him.	... _they	worshiped	the	beast,	saying,	“Who	is	like	the	_
       _beast,	and	who	is	able	to	wage	war	with	him?”	_ Revelation	13:4b
    c. For	the	remaining	half	of	the	Tribulation, the	Antichrist	will	be	given	direct	satanic	
       authority	to	act	and	speak	on	his	(Satan’s)	behalf.	 _There	was	given	to	him	a	_
       _mouth speaking	_ **_arrogant_** _words	and	blasphemies_ ,	a _nd	authority	to	act	for forty-two	_
       _months	was	given	to	him_ .	Revelation	13:5
    d. The	Antichrist	will	brazenly	speak	against	God.	 _And	he	opened	his	mouth	in	blasphemies	_
       _against	God,	to	_ **_blaspheme_** _His	name	and	His	tabernacle, that	is, those	who	dwell	in	_
       _heaven._ Revelation	13:6
    e. The	Antichrist	will	be	given	power	to	 **persecute** (to	pursue	and	kill)	believers.	 _It	was	also	_
       _given	to	him	to make	war	with	the	saints	and	to	overcome	them_ .	Revelation	13:7a
    f. The	Antichrist	will	be	given	 **global** rule	over	every	tribe,	tongue	and	nation.	... _and	_
       _authority	over every	tribe	and	people	and	tongue	and	nation	was	given	to	him_ .	
       Revelation	13:7b





13. Daniel	12:1a	– _Now	at	that	time	Michael,	the	great	prince	who	stands	guard	over	the	sons	of	_
    _your	people,	will	arise._ This	is	likely	a	reference	to	the	celestial	 **battle** predicted	in	
    Revelation	12:7-12	that	will	occur	at	the	midpoint	of	the	Tribulation	between	Michael	and	
    Satan.	This	battle	will	be	won	by	Michael.
14. Daniel	12:1b	– _And	there	will	be	a	time	of	distress	such	as	never	occurred	since	there	was	a	_
    _nation	until	that	time..._ According	to	Jesus	in	Matthew	24,	the	second	half	of	the	Tribulation	
    will	be	the	most	 **horrible** time	in	the	history	of	the	world,	especially	for	Israel	as	they	will	be	
    hunted	like	animals.	The	Antichrist	will	lead	the	world	in	unparalleled	antisemitic	hatred.
15. Daniel	12:1c	– _and	at	that	time	your	people,	everyone	who is	found	written	in	the	book,	will	_
    _be	rescued. At	that	time_ marks	the	end	of	the	Tribulation when	all	Israel	will	be	saved	(Rom.	
    11:26-27).	If	an	Israelite’s	name	is	written	in	the	book	of	life,	it	will	be	because	he	or	she	will	
    have	 **believed** in	Christ	as Messiah.	What	a	day	that	will	be!	Matthew	24:21

**I. Daniel	12:2- 4	 – The	end	of	the	age**

1. Daniel	12:2	– _Many	of	those	who	sleep	in	the	dust	of	the	ground	will	awake,	these	to	_
    _everlasting	life,	but	the	others	to	disgrace	and	everlasting	contempt._ This	verse	speaks	of	
    **two** resurrections.	There	is	the	first	resurrection	and	there	is	the	second	resurrection.	These	
    two	resurrections	are	separated	by	1000	years.
    a. **Blessed** are	those	who	partake	in	the	first	resurrection.	The	first	resurrection	comes	in	
       three	phases,	or	harvests.
       1) Christ	is	the	first-fruits;	He	is	the	first	one	to	have	been	resurrected	 **never** to	die	
          again.	1	Corinthians	15:20,	23-24;	Colossians	1:18;	Revelation	1:5
       2) The	second	harvest	is	the	church	at	the	 **Rapture** .	At	the	rapture	the	dead	in	Christ	
          will	rise	first,	and	then	those	who	are	still	alive	will	be	caught	up	with	them.	John	
          14:1-3,	1	Corinthians	15:50-57,	1	Thessalonians	4:13-18,	2	Thessalonians	2:3
       3) Old	Testament	saints	and	Tribulation	saints	will	rise	at	Christ’s	Second	Coming.	
          These will	constitute	the	third	and	final	harvest,	which	will	happen	just	 **prior** to	the	
          commencement	of	the	Millennial	Kingdom.	John	5:25-29,	Revelation	20:4- 6
    b. The	second	resurrection	will	occur	1000	years	after	the	first	resurrection, just	prior	to	
       the	Great	White	Throne	Judgment.	The	second	resurrection	is	not	a	favorable	one.	It	is	
       the	resurrection	of	the	 **unsaved** dead.	They	will	be	resurrected	so	they	can	face	
       judgment.	Revelation	20:5-7,	11- 15	
2. Daniel	12:3a	– _Those	who	have	insight	will	shine	brightly	like	the	brightness	of	the	expanse	_
    _of	heaven_ ...	Those	believers	who,	like Daniel,	by	God’s	grace	courageously **stand** for	the	
    truth	through	difficult	times	will	shine	in	extreme	glory	throughout	eternity.
3. Daniel	12:3b	– _...and	those	who	lead	the	many	to	righteousness,	like	the	stars	forever	and	_
    _ever_ .	Those	who	lead	 _the	many to	righteousness_ in	this	context	probably	refers	to	those	
    who	will	 **aid** Israel	at	the	cost	of	great	personal	risk	and	sacrifice.	These	will	be	rewarded	
    with	unfading	glory.	Matthew	25:34-40	speaks	of	just	such	people.





4. Daniel	12:4a	– _But	as	for	you,	Daniel,	conceal	these	words	and	seal	up	the	book	until	the	end	_
    _of	time..._ The	angel	told	Daniel	to	 _seal	up_ ,	meaning	to	 **preserve** ,	the	contents	of	this	book.	
    The	angel	did	not	mean	Daniel	should	hide	the	contents	of	the	book. Jeremiah	32:9- 12
5. Daniel	12:4b	– _...many	will	go	back	and	forth,	and	knowledge	will	increase._ To	 _go	back	and	_
    _forth	_ is	an	idiom	for	being	diligent	to	search	for	 **answers** .	The	angel	told	Daniel	to	preserve	
    the	contents	of	this	book	because	in	the	last	days	the	people	of	Israel	will	diligently	search	
    out	what	was	prophesied	concerning	the	70th week.

**J. Afterthoughts	from	Daniel	11**

1. The	battle	for	ultimate	control	of	the	kingdoms	of	the	 **world**.
    a. In	the	Garden	of	Eden,	 **Satan** got	control	of	the	world.	In	the wilderness,	Satan	made	a	
       legitimate	offer	to	Jesus	to	give Him	the	kingdoms	of	the	world.
    b. Luke	4:6- 7	 says,	“ _...And	the	devil	said	to	Him,	‘I	will	give	You	all	this	domain	and	its	glory;	_
       _for	it	has	been	handed	over	to	me,	and	I	_ **_give_** _it	to	whomever	I	wish.	Therefore,	if	You	_
       _worship	before	me,	it	shall	all	be	Yours’.”_
    c. Jesus	 **never** accepted	that	offer.	Luke	4:8	– _Jesus	answered	him,	“It	is	written,	‘YOU	_
       _SHALL	WORSHIP	THE	LORD	YOUR	GOD	AND	SERVE	HIM	ONLY.’”_
    d. In	the	Tribulation,	Satan	will	offer	the	kingdoms	of	the	world	to	the	Antichrist and	the	
       Antichrist will	accept	Satan’s	offer	to	rule	and	own	the	 **world**.
       1) Revelation	13:4	– ... _they	worshiped	the	dragon	because	_ **_he	gave his	authority	to	the	_**
          **_beast_** _;	and	they	worshiped	the	beast_ ...
       2) Revelation	13: 7 - 8a	– _It	was	also	_ **_given	to	him	_** _to	make	war	with	the	saints	and	to	_
          _overcome	them,	and	authority	_ **_over_** _every	tribe	and	people	and	tongue	and	nation	_
          **_was	given	to	him_** _.	All	who	dwell	on	the	earth	will	worship	him_ ...
2. In	Daniel	11	it	could	look	like	sinners	and	 **Satan** were	winning	the	battle,	but	take	a	closer	
    look.	Behind	the	scenes,	God	still	held overall	control.
    a. In	Daniel	11:24	we	see	God	at	work	 **limiting** Antiochus’s	triumphs,	“... _but	only	for	a	_
       _time_ ...”
    b. In	Daniel	11:27	when	two	kings	deceived	one	another,	God	had	the	 **last** word:	... _but	it	_
       _will	not	succeed,	for	the	end	is	still	to	come	at	the	appointed	time_ ...
    c. In	Daniel	11:29	we	see	Antiochus	Epiphanes	trying	to	overstretch	his	boundaries	and	we	
       hear	God	say of his	goals,	“... _but	this	last	time	it	will	not	turn	out	the	way	it	did	_ **_before_** ...”
    d. In	Daniel	11:35	when	believers	are	trying	to	make	sense	out	of	a	bad	situation,	we	hear	
       God	reminding	them	that	it’s	okay	... _because	it	_ [the	final	day] _is	still	to	come	at	the	_
       **_appointed_** _time_. God	is	sovereign.





**XVII. Daniel	12:5- 13	 – Concluding	the	Vision**

**A. Daniel	12:5- 8	 – Daniel saw	and	heard	Christ**

1. Daniel	12:5	– _Then	I,	Daniel,	looked	and	behold,	two	others	were	standing,	one	on	this	bank	_
    _of	the	river	and	the	other	on	that	bank	of	the	river._ Similar	to	the	vision	he	had	seen	in	
    Daniel	10:4-6,	Daniel	again	saw	the	pre-incarnate	Lord	 **Jesus** ,	this	time	in	the	air	above	the	
    Tigris	(Dan.	12:7).	There	were	also	two	new	angels,	one	on	either	bank	of	the	river.
2. Daniel	12:6	– _And	one	said	to	the	man	dressed	in	linen,	who	was	above	the	waters	of	the	_
    _river,	“How	long	will	it	be	until	the	end	of	these	wonders?”_ This	question	relates	to	the	
    duration	of	the	 **fierce** persecution	of	Israel	during	the	Tribulation	(the	seventieth	seven).
3. For	Israel,	the	Tribulation	is	going	to	be	so	 **severe** it	will	threaten	their	very	existence.	The	
    angel	in	verse	one	prophesied	that	... _there	will	be	a	time	of	distress	such	as	never	occurred	_
    _since	there	was	a	nation	until	that	time_ ...”	
    a. Revelation	6-19	describes	in	graphic	detail	this	 **dreadful** time	period.
    b. Zechariah	13:8	says	that	during	this time	only	one	out	of	three	Israelites	will	 **survive**.
4. In	Matthew	24:3-22,	 **Jesus** explained	just	how	perilous	those	days	would	be	for	Israel.
    a. Matthew	24:3	– _As	He	was	sitting	on	the	Mount	of	Olives,	the	disciples	came	to	Him	_
       _privately,	saying,	“Tell	us,	when	will	these	things	happen,	and	what	will	be	the	sign	of	_
       _Your	coming,	_ **_and	of	the	end	of	the	age_** _?”_ The	disciples’	 **question** was	very	similar	to	the	
       angel’s	question	to	Jesus	in	verse	six.
    b. Matthew	24:4- 6	 – _And	Jesus	answered	and	said	to	them,	“See	to	it	that	no	one	misleads	_
       _you.	For	many	will	come	in	My	name,	saying,	‘I	am	the	Christ,’	and	will	mislead	many.	_
       **_You	will	be	hearing	of wars	and	rumors	of	wars_** _.	See	that	you	are	not	frightened,	for	_
       _those	things	must	take	place,	_ **_but	that	is	not	yet	the	end_** _.”_
    c. Matthew	24:7- 8	 – _“For	nation	will	rise	against	nation,	and	kingdom	against	kingdom,	_
       _and	in	various	places	there	will	be	famines	and	earthquakes.	_ **_But	all	these	things	are	_**
       **_merely	the	beginning	of	birth	pangs_** _.”_ This	will	be	only	the	beginning	of	the	Tribulation.
    d. Matthew	24:9- 11	 – _“_ **_Then	they	will	deliver	you	[Israel]	to	tribulation,	and	will	kill	you,	_**
       **_and	you	will	be	hated	by	all	nations	because	of	My	name_** _.	At	that	time,	many	will	fall	_
       _away	and	will	betray	one	another	and	hate	one	another.	Many	false	prophets	will	arise	_
       _and	will	mislead	many.”_ The	Tribulation	and	will	be	a	time	of	severe	 **treachery**.
    e. Matthew	24:12- 14	 – _“Because	lawlessness	is	increased,	most	people’s	love	will	grow	_
       _cold.	But	the	one	who	endures	to	the	end,	he	will	be	saved.	This	gospel	of	the	kingdom	_
       _shall	be	preached	in	the	whole	world	as	a	testimony	to	all	the	nations,	_ **_and	then	the	end	_**
       **_will	come_** _.”_ Throughout	this	time,	the	Kingdom	 **gospel** will	be	preached.
    f. Matthew	24:15- 16	 – _“Therefore	when	you	see	the	ABOMINATION	OF	DESOLATION	which	_
       _was	spoken	of	through	Daniel	the	prophet,	standing	in	the	holy	place	(let	the	reader	_
       _understand),	then	_ **_those	who	are	in	Judea	must	flee	to	the	mountains_** _.”	_ The	midpoint	
       of	the	Tribulation	is	when	the	Antichrist	will	start his	 **genocide** against	Israel.






g. Matthew	24:17- 20	 – “Whoever	is	on	the	housetop	must	not	go	down	to	get	the	things	
out	that	are	in	his	house.	Whoever	is	in	the	field	must	not	turn	back	to	get	his	cloak.	But	
woe	to	those	who	are	pregnant	and	to	those	who	are	nursing	babies	in	those	days!	 But	
pray that	your	flight will	not	be	in	the	winter,	or	on	a	Sabbath.”
h. Matthew	24:21- 22	 – “For	then	 there	will	be	a	great tribulation,	such	as	has	not	
occurred	since	the	beginning	of	the	world	until	now,	nor	ever	will.	Unless	those	days	
had	been	cut	short,	no	life	would	have	been	saved ;	but	for	the	sake	of	the	elect	those	
days	will	be	cut	short.”

5. So	why	were	the	two	angels	 **present** with	the	pre-incarnate	Jesus at	this	time?


a. In	Matthew	18:16	Jesus	said,	“ But	if	he	does	not	listen	to	you,	take	one	or	two	more	with	
you,	 so	that	by	the	mouth	of	two	or	three	witnesses every	fact	may	be	confirmed .”
b. Jesus	is	going	to	make	a	crucial	 pledge concerning	the	duration	of	this terrible time	and	
the	two	angels are	going	to	witness	His	oath.

6. Daniel	12:7a	– _I	heard	the	man	dressed	in	linen	_ [the	pre-incarnate	Christ] _,	who	was	above	_
    _the	waters	of	the	river	..._ Once	more	Daniel	turned	his	 **attention** toward	the	Lord	who	was	
    suspended	above	the	Tigris	river.
7. Daniel	12:7b	– _I	heard	...	as	he	raised	his	right	hand	and	his	left	toward	heaven,	and	swore	_
    _by	Him	who	lives	forever	that	it	would	be	for	a	time,	times,	and	half	a	time..._ In	the	presence	
    of	the	two	angels,	the	Lord	Jesus	 **vowed** that	the	most	horrible part	of	the	Tribulation	would	
    last	only	3½	years.	During	the	Tribulation	this will	be	a	source	of	comfort. Daniel	7:25,	9:27
8. Daniel	12:7c	– _...as	soon	as	they	finish	shattering	the	power	of	the	holy	people,	all	these	_
    _events	will	be	completed_ .	Jesus	said	the	purpose	for	the	intense	3½-year	persecution	was	to	
    **shatter** the	power	of	Israel.	Zechariah	12:10- 14
    a. We	know	from	Daniel	9:24	that	there	are	six	 **purposes** for	the	70	sevens,	all	of	which	
       will	be	attained	by	the	end	of	the	Tribulation.
    b. The	70	sevens	were	designed	to	bring	Israel	to	humble	 **faith** in	Christ	as	Messiah	(Dan.	
       9:24).	In	His	oath,	Jesus	promised	that	in	the	end	Israel	would	be	humbled.	Israel’s	
       rebellion	will	be	shattered	forever.
    c. The	Tribulation	will	end	with	 **all** living	Israel	coming	to	believe	in	Messiah.	Daniel	9:24,	
       Matthew	23:39
    d. The	Bible	 **describes** these	still-future	events	in	many	passages	throughout	the	Old	
       Testament.	Deuteronomy	28,	30;	Isaiah	4:3-4,	6:11-13,	9:4-5,	14:3,	24:1-23,	26:20-21;	
       Jeremiah	30:4-11;	Zechariah	11:15-17,	13:7-9,	14:1- 2
9. Daniel	12:7d	– ... _all	these	events	will	be	completed_ ...	At	the	end	of	the	70th seven	... _all	these	_
    [prophesied]	 _events	_ [that	serve	to	reconcile	Israel	to	God]	 _will	be	completed_ .	You	have	
    God’s	word	on	it,	spoken	in an	oath,	 **witnessed** by	angels	and	recorded	here	by	Daniel.
10. Daniel	12:8	– _As	for	me,	I	heard	but	could	not	understand;	so	I	said,	“My	lord,	what	will	be	_
    _the	outcome	of	these	events?”_ Daniel	was	not	asking	 **when** the	Tribulation	would	end;	he	






was	asking	what	the	 outcome of	would	be.	Daniel	had	not	received	a	lot	of	insight	regarding
events	after	the	Tribulation	(the	Kingdom	and	the	eternal	state).	1	Peter	1:10- 12

**B. Daniel	12:9- 13	 – Christ’s	tells Daniel some	outcomes	of	these	events**

1. Daniel	12:9	– _He	said,	“Go	your	way,	Daniel,	for	these	words	are	concealed	and	sealed	up	_
    _until	the	end	time.”_ Jesus	did	not	give	Daniel	a	lot	of	information	here	about	the	 _outcome	of	_
    _these	events_ ,	like	he	did	later	to	John	the	Apostle	in	Revelation	19-22.	Jesus	did	however	
    give	a	few	important	 **_outcomes_** _of	these	events_.
2. Daniel	12:10	– _Many	will	be	purged,	purified	and	refined..._ God’s	 **purposes** in	Israel	passing	
    through	the	Tribulation	are	summarized	in	these	three	statements.	These	are	some	of	the	
    _outcomes	of	the	events_ of	the	Tribulation.	Daniel	9:24
    a. _Many	will	be	purged_ ...	Israelites who	do	not	believe	but	instead follow	the	Antichrist	will	
       be	 **removed** from	Israel.	Zechariah	13:8- 9 ,	Romans	9:6- 7
    b. _Many	will	be	...purified..._ The	heat,	pressure	and	fires	of	the	Tribulation	will	be	the	
       catalyst	for	the	 **salvation** of	many	in Israel.	Many	Jews	will come	to	know	the	Lord	as	
       their	Savior	and	be	 _purified_ .	Romans	11:25- 27
    c. _Many	will	be	...refined_ ...	The	harsh	persecution	is	going	to	 **perfect** the	 **faith** of	many	
       believing	Jews.	Job	23:10,	1	Peter	1:6- 9
3. Daniel	12:10a – _...but	the	wicked	will	act	wickedly,	and	none	of	the	wicked	will	understand..._
    The	Lord	explained	the	 _outcome_ of	those	who	do	not	gain	understanding	(unbelievers)	
    through	the	terrible	suffering	of	the	Tribulation.	They	will	continue	with	their	 **wickedness**.
4. Daniel	12:10b – _...but	those	who	have	insight	will	understand._ The	objective of	the	
    Tribulation	will	be	to	separate	the	chaff	from	the	wheat,	or	as	stated	here,	 _purge_ ,	 _purify_ ,	
    and	 _refine_ .	Those	who	have	insight,	meaning	believers,	will	 **understand** what	is	happening	
    during	these	bleakest hours	of	human	history.
5. Daniel	12:11	– _From	the	time	that	the	regular	sacrifice	is	abolished	and	the	abomination	of	_
    _desolation	is	set	up,	there	will	be	1,290	days_ .	The	second	 **half** of	the	Tribulation	will	last	
    1260	days	according	to	Daniel	12:7.	What	about	the	extra	30	days	mentioned	here?
    a. The	30	days	mentioned	here	may	include	the	time	needed	to	set	up	thrones	and	
       convene	courts	for	judgment	before	the	Millennial	Kingdom	begins.	As	the	following	
       verses	affirm,	there	is	indeed	a	 **judgment** slated	to	follow	the	end	of	the	Tribulation.
       1) Revelation	20:4a	- _Then	I	saw	_ **_thrones_** _,	and	they	sat	on	them,	and	judgment	was	_
          _given	to	them_.
       2) Matthew	19:28	– _Jesus	said	to	them,	“Truly	I	tell	you,	in	the	renewal	of	all	things,	_
          _when	the	Son	of	Man	sits	on	His	glorious	throne,	you	who	have	followed	Me	will	also	_
          _sit	on	twelve	thrones,	_ **_judging_** _the	twelve	tribes	of	Israel.”_
       3) Matthew	25:31- 32	 – _But	when	the	Son	of	Man	comes	in	His	glory,	and	all	the	angels	_
          _with	Him,	then	He	will	sit	on	His	glorious	throne.	All	the	_ **_nations_** _will	be	gathered	_






before	Him;	and	He	will	separate	them	from	one	another,	as	the	shepherd	separates	
the	sheep	from	the	goats.
b. Therefore,	the	30	days	may	be	the	 time required	to	launch all	of	these	tribunals.

6. Daniel	12:12	– _“How	blessed	is	he	who	keeps	_ **_waiting_** _and	attains	to	the	1,335	days!”_ Now	
    we	have	yet	another	date.	This	includes	an	additional	45	days	beyond	the	30	days	
    mentioned	in	Daniel	12:11,	giving	us	a	total	of	75	days.	What	is	the	significance	here?
    a. The	best	answer	is	that	the	75th day	is	inauguration	day	for	the	Millennial	Kingdom.	
       Those	who	make	it	to	this	day	are	truly	blessed	because	they	have	passed	through	the	
       judgments	and	are	now	invited	to	inherit	the	Kingdom.	That	will	be a	truly	 **blessed** day	
       and	a	day	for	which	to	patiently	yearn.	Matthew	25:34
    b. The	75	days	are	not	too	long	or	too	short	to	prepare	for	the	 **greatest** day	this	earth	will	
       have	ever seen.	Time	will	be	needed	to	clean	up	the	earth	(Is.	35:1-10)	and	to	convene	
       judgments	in	preparation	for	the	perfect	rule	of	Christ	on	earth.	Ezekiel	20:34-38,	
       Matthew	25:31- 46
7. Daniel	12:13a – _But	as	for	you,	go	your	way	to	the	end...._ We	do	not	have	any	record	of	
    Daniel	ever	returning	to	Jerusalem.	His	age	and	position	in	the	Persian	government	
    probably	precluded	this.	The	Lord	encouraged	him	here	to	 **continue** on	his	path	in	life	until	
    death.
8. Daniel	12:13	– _...then	you	will	enter	into	rest	and	rise	again	for	your	allotted	portion	at	the	_
    _end	of	the	age._ This	verse	teaches	the	 **resurrection** of	the	dead.	Although	Daniel	would	die,	
    he	would	be	raised	again	to	enter	the	Millennial	Kingdom,	where	he	would	receive	his	
    reward	( _allotted	portion_ ).
    a. Notice that	Daniel’s	understanding	of	the	end	times	events	and	prophecy	in	no	way	
       paralyzed	him.	He	did	not	stop	living	or	go	into	 **hiding** .	Titus	2:11- 13
    b. He	did	not	stock	pile	food	or	dig	a	bomb	shelter	out	of	 **fear** of	the	future.
    c. God	promised	him	a	 **place** in	the	coming	Kingdom	at	the	end	of	the	times	of	the	
       Gentiles.
    d. Likewise,	Christ	encouraged	us	with	these	words	recorded	by	the	apostle	John	in	
       Revelation	22:20- 21 ,	“ _He	who	testifies	to	these	things	says,	‘Yes,	I	am	_ **_coming_** _quickly.’_
       _Amen.	Come,	Lord	Jesus.	The	grace	of	the	Lord	Jesus	be	with	all.	Amen._ ”

**C. Final	points	to	ponder**

1. In	Daniel,	we	have	seen	God’s	 **two-track** plan:	His	plan	for	Israel	and	His	plan	for	the	Gentile	
    nations.	Through	history	these	two	tracks	have	run	side	by	side.
    a. The	times	of	the	Gentiles	(the	rule	of	sinful	man)	will	end	at	the	Battle	of	 **Armageddon**
       when	Christ	gains	the	final	victory	forever.
    b. At	the	end	of	the	Tribulation,	Israel	will	finally	receive	her	promised,	glorious	 **kingdom**.
2. Our	God	reigns.






a. God	is	sovereign over	all.	Nothing	takes	God	by	surprise	or	catches	Him	off	guard.	
Without	taking	a	break,	He	controls	the	entire	universe.	Evil	angels	scheme,	evil	men	
plot,	good	men	fail,	but	God	 prevails over	all.	Psalm	146:10,	Luke	1:33
b. God	is	in	control	of	every	detail	of	your	life.	Nothing	reaches	you	that	has	not	first	been	
filtered	through	His	hands.	In	both	the	good	and	bad	days	of	life,	you	can	 trust Him	fully.	
Psalm	139:1-18,	Romans	8:28- 29
c. God	is	always	 victorious in	His	plans.	He	is	bringing	the	chaos	of	earth to	a	good	
conclusion.	The	righteous	reign	of	Jesus	Christ	is	on	its	way.	Psalm	2:4-6,	John	16:33
d. We	of	all	people	have	 hope .	Ephesians	1:18,	Romans	15:13,	1	Corinthians	15:56- 58

3. What	about	our	 **reaction** to	the	hard	times we	face? Psalm	11,	56:3


a. You	do	not	have	to	wring	your	hands	or	give	up	in	 despair. Isaiah	41:10,	Romans	8:31
b. You	do	not	have	to	abandon	your	 faith when	the	going	gets	rough. 1	Kings	18:21,	
Galatians	1:10,	3:1
c. You	don’t	need	to	 hide in	the	shadows;	we	are	not	the	losers	in	life. Matthew	10:28
d. We	don’t	sacrifice	the	 truth .	We	are	to	speak	and	live	our	lives	by	faith	in	our	faithful	
Lord	Jesus	Christ. Colossians	2:6
e. When	hard	times	come,	and	they	will,	the	righteous	get	 purified and	the	unrighteous	
get	open	to	hear	the	message.	In	hard	days,	take	the	opportunities	that	come	your	way.
Romans	13:11-14,	Ephesians	5:16
f. Thank	the	Lord	that	we	will	never	face	the	seven	years	of	tribulation,	the	time	when	
God	will	pour	out	his	wrath	on	this	earth.	1	Thessalonians	5:9
